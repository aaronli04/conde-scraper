Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Twenty-six years on, Ellerman House is still everybody’s fantasy bolthole in Cape Town: minutes from the best beaches and the Table Mountain cableway, but close enough to the city and its dynamic food, art, and design scene. Sandwiched between Lion’s Head and the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Edwardian mansion looks like a private residence from the road and that’s exactly what keeps guests coming back. Owner Paul Harris takes enormous pride in his country—his impressive collection of South African art spans original works from the turn of the last century to current contemporary art. An informal tour of the collection with one of the in-house art experts is a fascinating lesson in the country’s socio-political history. Then there are the 7,500 bottles of rare and vintage South African wines in the cellar, and the indigenous plants sourced from Kirstenbosch (Cape Town’s botanical garden) in the 1.5-acre terraced gardens. Besides the main house, there are two modern, minimalist private villas built into the granite mountainside, as well as a wine gallery, and an excellent little spa. ","['Start us off with an overview.\nFrom the road, Ellerman House looks like a grand, private residence (of which there are plenty in upscale Bantry Bay). Where many historic properties were demolished to make way for architecturally daring concrete-and-glass show homes, Ellerman House is an original Cape Edwardian mansion that dates back to 1906. Provenance and history is what sets it apart from other boutique hotels on the Atlantic Ocean. Over the years, owner Paul Harris has restored the old lady extensively, and transformed the one-and-a-half acre garden into an indigenous showpiece—like a little slice of \nKirstenbosch botanical gardens\n by the sea. Once through the security controlled front door of the main house, you descend the art-lined wooden staircase to the lower floor which leads through a series of elegant lounges to a deep, shaded veranda. This gives way to terraced lawns, a swimming pool and a sea view that you won’t easily forget.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nMany guests are regulars, many are British, especially those who return annually in the summer months. In winter, American and other foreign globetrotters, fresh from a five-star safari.', 'Now, onto the good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nI have stayed in one of the rooms at the top of the house with a balcony and a magnificent sea view. To fall asleep at night with the balcony doors wide open, listening to the crash of the surf on the shore far below, was sheer bliss. While the hotel bar is a glamorous spot for a sundowner drink, all I wanted to do was pour a glass of wine and watch the sun sink into the ocean in delicious solitude (Bantry Bay sunsets are epic, especially in winter). The room had the feel of a private guest bedroom with deep-pile carpets, antique furniture, books, compelling original artworks and expensive fabrics and crisp bedlinen. The en suite bathroom was spacious and bright. Each of the 13 rooms is completely different in character, but all are classically decorated in comparison to the two exclusive-use villas which have minimalist interiors in keeping with the contemporary design.', ""How about the little things, like the mini bar, or the shower goodies? Anything you'd like to shout out?\nThere are so many ‘wow’ factors here, but the extensive collection of original South African art dating back to the 19th century is unique. You could call this an art gallery with a hotel attached, as every room and all available wall space is hung with original and rare art from the Harris family’s private collection. The garden is a gallery for sculptures, and there’s even a contemporary art gallery below the swimming pool where an eclectic, thought-provoking collection is exhibited on a rotational basis throughout the year."", 'I also loved the walk-in ‘pantry’, stocked with sweet and savory treats and homemade snacks, including sweets, cookies, cakes, granola bars, roasted nuts and sandwiches. All drinks are included, except for wine and Champagne.', 'How about the food. Worth it?\nFood and wine are taken very seriously here. It’s all overseen by newly appointed food director Peter Templehoff, a Relais & Chateaux grand chef who also heads up his own restaurant, Fyn, in the city center. A new focus on wellness means that healthy, nourishing food is the rule, rather than the exception. That said, you can eat whatever you want. The chefs dream up seasonal menus of modern classics for lunch and dinner every day, always including healthy, plant-based options, because that’s how the owners like to eat, but you can also ask the chefs to prepare whatever you feel like eating. Wine pairings are considered suggestions by resident sommelier, Wayve, who oversees the impressive wine gallery, with temperature-controlled white, red and sparkling wine storage for 7,500 bottles. Don’t miss a private tasting in this subterranean space with its packed-earth terroir wall and inviting bar. Note that dining here is only for in-house guests, as the hotel is private and the restaurant is not open to the general public.', 'Was there any member of the staff that stood out in your mind, and if so, why?\n I’m not sure what the guest-to-staff ratio is here, but it feels as if you have your own member of staff personally taking care of you from the moment you arrive. GM Paul Bruce-Brand is a gracious host with a great sense of humor and an obvious love for South Africa.', 'Tell us what we missed.\n It’s worth taking a tour of the substantial art collection with in-house art guide Talita Swarts, who brings the paintings and sculptures to life with her quirky, often humorous details about the artists, their personal lives and the social contexts in which they lived and experienced life.', 'Bottom line: Worth it, and why?\n You’ll experience the very best of everything South Africa has to offer, from food and wine to art and the staggering natural beauty of mountain and ocean.

Gorgeous George,"Hot List, 2020.",1,"No matter what design wizardry unfolds inside Cape Town hotels, the superlative views of Table Mountain always end up stealing the show. But this quirky stay in the heart of the still-rough-around-the-edges Central Business District, gives visitors a fresh perspective. Thanks to its vantage point above the richly textured architecture of the city bowl, the windows look out over neoclassical landmarks, observing gabled Cape Dutch rooftops in conversation with Art Deco towers. It took six years for the owners to seamlessly renovate an Art Deco structure and its Edwardian neighbor, and given this mishmash of influences, the result is a hotel that could exist nowhere in the world but in the heart of the Mother City. Designer Tristan du Plessis imbued the interiors with a strong “local is lekker” sensibility, to borrow a popular South African catchphrase, which prizes things made close to home. In the lobby this means blue-and-white Delft tiles by Capetonian ceramist Lucie de Moyencourt that map out the neighborhood and South African brands like the plush leather sofas from Artifact (cushiness quotient: high). Gorgeous George lives up to its name— it’s just the kind of clever, design-centric hideaway that the area sorely lacked. —Sarah Khan","[""What's the backstory here?\nIt's an independent hotel, and took several years to come to life because it's the merging of two distinctive adjacent buildings—an Art Deco building and an Edwardian building— that took a long time to restore. I've had my eye on it since before I moved back to the States in 2016 from South Africa, and after many hiccups and delays, I'm excited it's finally here. And I lament the fact that it didn't exist when I lived here, because it's just the kind of original, design-focused, intimate hotel a design-obsessed city like \nCape Town\n needs and deserves, and is the only property taking advantage of the striking architecture and setting of the city's \nCentral Business District\n (CBD) in a creative, luxurious, chic way."", ""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\nFirst, some context: I lived in the CBD, a block away from the hotel (I can see my old apartment building from my room's window), and I know the area well and love it. That being said, it can feel dicey after dark, which would not be a problem if you could get dropped off directly at the front door, as you can at the nearby \nTaj Hotel.\n But since St. George's Mall, where Gorgeous George is located, is a pedestrian street, the nearest drop-off point by car is half a block away—which, though it's just a matter of a few feet, did not feel optimal when I arrived from the airport at 11 p.m.. Knowing the area, I was prepared for this and called ahead to make sure someone would be able to come meet me at my Uber (they have doormen standing out front who keep an eye out for hotel visitors), but for a guest who might be unfamiliar with the area and arriving at night with lots of luggage (and not thinking they might need to call ahead), it can feel intimidating and is not the best first impression. I'm told they do have plans to have a more visible presence at the nearest curbside though, and they are aware of the concerns. The hotel entrance itself is discreet and easy to miss."", ""Once inside, though, there's a small reception area, with the standout being a beautiful map of the Cape Town city center done entirely in distinctive blue-and-white ceramic tiles by local artist Lucie de Moyencourt. The staff is friendly and warm. The elevator and floors are dimly lit and cozy, with bold floral carpeting from Moooi Carpets."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations.\nThere are 32 rooms spread out over four floors, and I'm in 208, a Studio room. It is spacious while still feeling cozy—super-high ceilings with industrial exposed pipes contrasted with warm colors and accents, like a plush burgundy couch, a round blue-and-white rug from Moooi Carpets reminiscent of Delft tiles, sumptuous bedding, and a rich leather headboard. Lucie de Moyencourt's tiles make another appearance in the rooms as the backsplash for the bar, where local wines and Amarula are stocked. There's an array of different light fixtures, all industrial inspired, including a cool pendant lamp suspended from the high ceiling to just above the nightstand. Despite being on the second floor in the center of town, I didn't really feel like noise was an issue, but earplugs are helpfully provided just in case. My view was directly into an office building and a KFC below, but if I looked to the left I could see the action at \nGreenmarket Square\n (and if I looked to the right, Adderley Street and my old highrise). The phone was a cute rotary situation and there's a retro-style Marshall radio, and the TV has Netflix included, which was nice."", 'That said, the bathroom was not optimally designed. It looks great, all gleaming white subway tiles, a fabulous rain shower, and marble topped vanity by famous local designer Gregor Jenkins (he also did the long, narrow desks in the bedrooms). But storage is limited, with not much room on the vanity and no drawers or shelves either by the sink or in the shower to put much of anything. The bath products, made for the hotel by the Scentuary, are lovely, with bright, herbaceous tones.', ""Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nGood Wi-Fi is often an issue in South Africa, but at Gorgeous George it's strong and ubiquitous."", 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThere\'s one restaurant at Gorgeous George: Gigi, the indoor/outdoor rooftop space. Breakfast here is included, and ranges from avocado toasts and omelettes stuffed with pancetta, chili, and feta to decadent pancakes with berries and cream. The space is beautifully done: there\'s a lounge area with cozy mismatched furniture, lots of old volumes and new design books on the bookshelves, and knickknacks ranging from porcelain parrot-shaped candleholders to a giant buffalo skull. The indoor dining area, next to the wood-paneled bar, has blue-and-white-tiled tabletops that, upon closer inspection, are a whimsical sendup of the traditional Delft tiles found across the city. (Keep an eye out for modern-day vignettes on the tiles, like yoga poses and selfie-taking friends.) The crown jewel is the outdoor area, with a beautiful, if tiny pool, with one half in a covered area painted by artist David Britz, a lit-up sign that says ""Hello Gorgeous,"" colorful green/black/yellow stools, and pots and pots of plants in every corner, giving a nice lush environment while you\'re surrounded by the city skyline. It\'s promising to become quite the hangout for Capetonians and visitors alike, especially come summer. If this had been around when I lived next door, I would have been on the rooftop every single day.', ""And the service?\nPeople here are warm and helpful. I especially loved the staff at the restaurant, they're fun and friendly, and everyone I encountered at the front desk had a big smile and was lovely to interact with."", ""What type of travelers will you find here?\nMy first impression when I first saw the rooftop was that this is Cape Town's Soho House set—a hip, creative crowd that makes the glamorous setting look even more glamorous. It's also a bit more diverse than most places in Cape Town—though definitely not diverse enough, as the numbers while I was there still skewed 90 percent white. The actual hotel guests have to be a bit more savvy than the average tourist to have chosen to stay at a place like this, since most visitors tend to stay at the standard resorts and cookie cutter options at the touristy V&A Waterfront—if you've chosen to stay at a new, small boutique hotel in the heart of the CBD, you have to be cut from a different cloth than most visitors."", ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\nAs I've mentioned, I love the CBD, and often lamented that there weren't many great options for travelers to stay here—there's the Taj around the corner, which is nice but more of a business/luxury hotel model, and there are scores of backpackers and more basic options. But true luxury and high-design rooms taking advantage of the striking architecture that prevails in the CBD—it's about time! You're steps from everything here: touristy finds at \nGreenmarket Square\n, the rapidly evolving Buitenkant and Harrington streets just a few blocks east, the divey bars of Long Street, the chic boutiques and restaurants of Bree and Loop Streets. And now the rooftop of Gorgeous George itself is becoming a destination for locals popping by for lunch or late night drinks (or the soon-to-start Sunday brunch/DJ vibe), so staying here is a great way to mingle with the who's who of Cape Town."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nAs I mentioned, the entrance situation feels iffy, especially if you're unaware of Cape Town and arriving late at night. It sounds like the hotel is very aware of this and has plans to make the arrival more clear-cut and secure, but guests should still be advised when they make a booking that they should call the hotel when they're on the way so the front desk can keep an eye out."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\nThere's no gym, but guests get a pass to go to the Ignite Fitness gym next door, which is huge and fully equipped and great. The rooftop pool is tiny but beautiful—more an Instagram-only kind of spot as opposed to anywhere you'd want to swim laps, but it's really distinctive."", ""Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\nYes, yes, yes. Finally there's a place to stay in the city's coolest neighborhood that does its architecture and design sensibility justice. No one should stay at the Waterfront again!""]","118 St Georges Mall, Cape Town 8000, South Africa",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/cape-town/gorgeous-george,https://www.gorgeousgeorge.co.za/

Although there isn’t a garden, there is a pool deck with sun loungers. There's also a small gym and underground parking."", 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nAll the advantages of a five-star hotel without losing touch with the Waterfront’s working harbor origins—fishing trawlers and tugs come and go and the dry docks always busy.

The city's fastest elevator will zip you to the 103rd floor where check-in, diamond jewelers, and four restaurants await."", 'Nice. What’s the crowd like?\nThe hotel draws so many tourists up to its Ozone bar (the highest hotel bar in the world at 1,607 feet above sea level) that it’s hard to know for sure who’s staying overnight and who’s passing through for a drink. But given the hotel’s direct access to the ICC offices, you can expect a big contingent of corporate types.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nAll 312 rooms and suites promise at least 540 square feet of space—some face Victoria Harbour, others the South China Sea. In the Club Deluxe Victoria Harbour Room, an east-meet-west design feels rich and warm, all burgundy, deep green and beige. Leather-paneled walls add to the luxe feel, as does the skyline view from the comfortable workspace.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe bed—king-size mattress, 400-thread-count linens, down pillows—felt amazing.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nEach room includes a Nespresso coffee machine, premium teas, 42-inch flat screen LCD TV and an iPod docking station. The Club rooms and suites offer access to the 24-hour Club Lounge on the 116th floor. Club Lounge access is worth it for the all-day perks, beginning with complimentary breakfast, refreshments and snacks, afternoon tea, happy hour, plus express check-in and check-out services.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nThe luxurious marble-tiled bathrooms come well equipped with fluffy bathrobes, double vanities, rain showers, and a corner tub with an LCD TV built into the wall, so that you can catch up on the news (or Game of Thrones) while you soak the day away.', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nFree and speedy Wi-Fi keeps guests (and visitors) happy.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong hosts an impressive lineup of far-flung flavors, from beautiful Italian creations at Michelin-starred Tosca, classic Cantonese at two-Michelin-starred Tin Lung Heen, a popular afternoon tea at Cafe 103, and all-day dining at the Lounge & Bar. Ozone bar might be best known as Hong Kong’s highest watering hole, but it’s actually home to a restaurant as well. Diners can sit inside the avant-garde space for Asian tapas, sushi or a leisurely Sunday brunch. No matter where you dine in the hotel, you’re guaranteed unmatched views of Victoria Harbour. Up on the 116th floor lies the Ritz-Carlton Spa—one of the most luxurious pampering pads in the city. There are nine treatment rooms (including two spa suites), all with harbor views. But before your signature body treatment (try the warm lava shell massage for tense muscles), head for the crystal steam bath and experience showers with settings like “Arctic mist” and “tropical rain” in the changing area. Before or after every treatment, guests are encouraged to settle in the relaxation room. The dimly lit lounge has reclining chairs with cashmere blankets, freshly brewed tea, and snacks like dried fruit, nuts and cookies. On the 118th floor, the hotel also has an indoor infinity pool and a spacious gym—both overlooking the harbor.', ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe only criticisms we can muster about the Ritz-Carlton is the concentration of tourists roaming about the lobby waiting to visit the Ozone bar and the less-than-ideal location. Unless you're working in the ICC, West Kowloon doesn’t offer much to do other than shop at Elements mall. There’s also a lot of construction in the area, which makes walking around on foot difficult. That said, the location does have one big plus: It’s right atop the Airport Express Kowloon station, about 15-20 minutes from the airport. You can check your bags at the stations, so you don't have to carry them to the airport."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThe Ritz-Carlton's Hong Kong location doesn't disappoint: Expect Michelin-starred restaurants, spacious rooms, panoramic harbor views, and superlative service from start to finish.""]","International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Rd.

The experience includes fluffy croissants and homemade jams, a choice of mains, and French press coffee."", ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe concierge team has a knack for snagging reservations at booked-out restaurants and directing you toward under-the-radar cultural excursions.

Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThis is a dining destination that draws both travelers and locals alike. The hotel’s lobby has a destination for afternoon tea—a not-to-miss experience no matter where you’re staying in Hong Kong. Guests can make a reservation and skip the queue. Elsewhere, there’s classic French restaurant Gaddi’s, avant-garde bar and restaurant Felix, Swiss cuisine at Chesa, and delicious, authentic Cantonese at Michelin-starred Spring Moon. The 12,000-square-foot Peninsula Spa is an indisputable star and a sanctuary of serenity in buzzing Hong Kong. The relaxing heat facilities are reason enough to visit— try the dry sauna overlooking Victoria Harbour and the crystal steam room. On the same floor lies an indoor pool (designed like a Roman bath house with columns and friezes), as well as an outdoor terrace and fitness center. Those traveling with children will appreciate the junior guest amenities, which include complimentary cots, child- or baby-sized bathrobes, gentle shower products, teething rings, toothbrushes, kids' menus, in-room entertainment (like movies and coloring books), and babysitting."", 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe pool area gets mixed reviews: Either you love the Roman-style design and indoor setting, or you long for a larger pool deck and outdoor swimming. Either way, the panoramic harbor views are hard to argue with. One other caveat: Steer clear of the lobby in the early afternoon (unless you’re sitting down for tea) as it’s often teeming with tourists passing through to take pictures or waiting for tea.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nCombining an old-school Hong Kong feel with contemporary comfort, The Peninsula specializes in world-class service—whether your mission is business or pleasure.']","Salisbury Rd., Hong Kong, China",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/china/yau-ma-tei/the-peninsula-hong-kong,http://hongkong.peninsula.com/en/default

Atop the JW Marriott, but completely distinct from it, the Upper House used to be serviced apartments. Part of the Swire boutique collection of Houses (Opposite, Middle, Temple), its interiors were designed by Hong Kong wunderkind Andre Fu.', 'Got it. So tell us about your room.\nUpper Suite. Crisp, clean design—with arresting metropolitan and marine views. Cushioned window seats, hippo-sized tub, Jacob Jensen alarm clock. Lights that switch on and off without any fiddling; a wide chrome handle to flush the toilet. I’d return like a shot. The backgammon board is a nice touch, even if you don’t play. The coffee-table book selection seems more for show.', ""Say we're famished. What are our options?\nGray Kunz has a restaurant on site. Immediate neighbors at dinner: Chinese tycoon grandparents treating their progeny; Mr. & Mrs. Cashed-Up Senior Tourist; couple on second or third date (he did most of the talking). Modern European cuisine. The lamb rack tagine with apricots, dates, and merguez is beautifully balanced and intelligently presented (Chinese grandpa looked across intently when it was delivered). Breakfast does a neat East/West tango: think congee with ginger and coriander, quinoa yogurt porridge with passion fruit."", 'How did you find service overall?\nAll guests are whisked upstairs; check-in is accomplished in a trice and the room how-tos courteously explained. That a maintenance worker paused in his task to wish me ""good morning"" and open the door to the lawn is the best service indicator.', 'Imagine the other guests are part of a tribe. How would you describe them?\nWell-traveled, well-heeled, well-to-do. See above for dinner guests.', ""What about the neighborhood? Anything we should know about this hotel's location?\nIt’s atop Pacific Place mall, which is atop the metro station. Conrad, Shangri-La, JW Marriott in hailing distance. A swathe of retail, like Harvey Nichols, King & Country (model soldiers) all are nearby. Possibly the most comfortable cinema in Hong Kong, too. And there's the Hong Kong Park and aviary and tea museum next door. Trams (street and Peak) are within walking distance.

The artworks—Damien Hirst, Joe Bradley, et al.—fit seamlessly, and the hotel manages to pull off a neat blend of East and West (placing a rather traditional Chinese restaurant next to a tapas-inspired gastro market, for instance). The hotel is very \nHong Kong\n in that it’s confident in its high-end status, almost bordering on flashy, yet innovative and youthful and fresh."", 'What’s the backstory?\n The Cheng family owners originally came from Shunde in China. They did well in jewelry and real estate, and redeveloped the site to accommodate an office tower, a mall, and a \nRosewood\n (they bought the group back in 2011, with Sonia Cheng, then 30, as its CEO). The hotel is a trophy project, for sure, but one that’s been achieved with more than a little panache.', 'What can we expect in our room?\n The views—mainly harbor but some over the city—can be enjoyed from the freestanding tub, while in the more expensive rooms bottles of spirits line the drinks table and arresting artworks speckle the walls. That the soaps (Maison Caulières) and similar amenities change to reflect the seasons is the best indicator of the attention to detail applied in putting together a very superior home away from home.', 'How about the food and drink?\n There’s nothing random here—everything has been carefully thought-out to cater to all possible tastes. Breakfast at Holt’s Café skips about between Western, Asian, and the ultra-healthy; the list of teas at the Butterfly Patisserie runs to dozens of pages; breezy Bayfare Social is seemingly but half a step down from the Food Hall at Harrods and is complemented by Henry, a grill piloted by the multi-tattooed, multi-talented British chef Nathan Green (it’s very meat-centric, the artisanal sausages are sublime). The list goes on though; minced fish soup with fungus and tangerine peel spice up the menu at the Legacy House and Harley-Davidsons park up to hit DarkSide for live jazz even on Monday evenings.', 'What’s the crowd like?\n The Cheng family is so wealthy as to be remarkable in Hong Kong, a fact reflected by the clientele—be they residents dropping by for lunch or drinks or visitors from overseas flying in on business.', 'Anything to say about the service?\n When the waiter spilled a couple of drops of wine at lunch (it happens), both apology and clearing-up were swift and deft. Such professionalism.', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?\n The Rosewood’s opening marked the final act of a highly theatrical renaissance in the area that’s seen both the nearby Hong Kong Museum of Art and the harborfront promenade revamped, as well as the advent of K11 Musea, an inspiring mix of retail and entertainment that is so much more than a mall. Both metro and ferries are more or less on the doorstep.', 'Anything else to add?\n Asaya, occupying an entire floor, describes itself as an ""integrated wellness center,"" which although sounds rather gimmicky is fair enough as ""spa"" would be woefully inadequate. Treatments are holistic in nature and delivered with real passion. The option of staying overnight and dining in situ is a clever addition.', 'Anything you’d change?\n Of course, it’s sheer indulgence to suggest Asaya’s heated marble lie-flat shower should be widened to accommodate a couple.', 'Is it worth it?\n It’s quite the smartest (in all senses of the word) hotel in Hong Kong, and likely to remain so for some time to come.']","No18, Salisbury Rd, Hong Kong, China",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/hong-kong/hong-kong/rosewood-hong-kong,https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/hong-kong

The light-filled lobby feels calm, with a glass facade straight ahead and music drifting from the Lounge restaurant."", 'Nice.

Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nSeveral award-winning restaurants sit under this roof. A favorite for power lunches and unhurried afternoon tea, the Lounge restaurant near the lobby serves refined Italian alongside live music. On the fourth floor, three-Michelin-starred Lung King Heen draws as many locals as guests with its fine-dining Cantonese. Two floors up, Caprice turns out world-class French cuisine. If you’re not in the mood for a three-hour affair, the adjacent Caprice Bar provides a serene place to unwind with a glass of Burgundy and cheese. If you're meeting a group, try the Blue Bar on the ground floor where there’s an alfresco terrace, as well as a large wooden bar and pretty Murano glass mosaics. The martini here is a must. Wellness has become a significant part of the Four Seasons Hong Kong experience, with visiting meditation and yoga gurus at the spa, early morning tai chi on weekends, and therapeutic treatments. Before a facial or massage, a visit to the Vitality Lounge will put you in the zone; there's a crystal steam room, vitality pool, jet pool, heated stone seats, saunas, and ice fountains. You’ll want to clear an afternoon to enjoy the four harborfront pools: a heated outdoor infinity pool, lap pool, cold plunge pool, and steamy whirlpool. Margaritas and healthy smoothies from the Pool Terrace restaurant and bar aim to keep you quenched."", 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nLooking at a map shows you practically sitting atop the Airport Express and MTR, but on our first visit, we found it difficult to navigate IFC mall—particularly when looking for the Airport Express station after check out. Ask for help in advance or book a car transfer. On the positive side (there is much on this side), we savored every moment in the Club lounge with a sundowner in hand, watching ships cruise by.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nTake excellent service, splurge-worthy restaurants, and a convenient location near the MTR and ferry piers and you have one of Hong Kong’s top hotels.']","8 Finance St., Hong Kong, China",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/hong-kong-s-a-r-/wan-chai-gap/four-seasons-hong-kong,http://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"It can’t be easy being a living legend, a global icon, an object of universal reverence. What happens when, eventually, you have to renovate and possibly even change? In the case of Raffles Singapore, you do so in a way that appears effortless and natural. The good news at this 133-year-old classic is that all that was irreplaceable has been preserved, down to the wicker chairs and ceiling fans that provide so much ambience. Several of the most visible new additions involve food and drink—the restaurants by Anne-Sophie Pic, Jereme Leung, and Alain Ducasse; the revamped and expanded Writers Bar; the freshly polished and gleaming Tiffin Room. And then there are the design flourishes, courtesy of Alexandra Champalimaud—often mere details, such as trunk-style cocktail cabinets or Peranakan-mosaic bathroom tiles, that are in keeping with the historic spirit of the place while imparting a bright, contemporary energy.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nIt may well be that no hotel is more closely associated with its city than \nRaffles Singapore\n. It has gone through various mutations in the 130 or so years since it opened, as a modest 10-room bungalow, in 1887. By the early 20th century it had pretty much assumed the physical form that it retains today and attained something like mythical status.', 'What’s the story?\n\xa0\nLong and complicated. The sort of story that people write books about. (As a matter of fact, the great Pico Iyer has just written a brilliant book about it, a copy of which you may, I suspect, find on your bedside table on your next visit to Raffles, as well as in the Writers Bar and the Hamleys-like Raffles Boutique.) Long story short, though, the old bird needed a bit of zhuzhing-up. The zhuzhing-up took closer to three years than two to complete, and repeated delays along the way had some observers and Raffles loyalists—including me—more than a little twitchy. Would it all be OK in the end? Had something gone terribly, terribly wrong? It would, and it had not. The good bits have all been preserved. The less good bits, or in any case those that simply had to change, have been given the treatment. Most of that treatment has come courtesy of Alexandra Champalimaud, who previously waved her hard-to-define, contemporary-classic wand over the Plaza in New York and the Dorchester in London, among many other hotels. I cannot help thinking that this is the best of the lot.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nAn extremely pleasant surprise. (And by the way, it is not a ""room."" Suites only, almost all of them arranged according to a typically tropical ""tripartite"" design, whereby you pass from veranda to parlor to bedroom and bathroom.) Out with most of the Victoriana, in with the hard-to-define, contemporary-classic style mentioned above—though with enough echoes of what went before that you will not feel freaked out. The brass bell buttons turned light switches? Still there. The ceiling fans, wicker chairs, ceramic lamps? Present and correct, just in smaller quantities than previously, and now obliged to make polite conversation with Alexandra Champalimaud’s additions.', 'How about the food and drink?\n\xa0\nHow about it? The most radical changes all concern food and drink in one way or another. Anne-Sophie Pic’s exquisite La Dame de Pic has elicited gasps of delight; my claim to first-in status rests on having been the first member of the press to be dazzled by Jereme Leung’s Yi (whose otherworldly little entrance area is destined to be more photographed than the vast concrete banana atop Marina Bay Sands); and Alain Ducasse’s BBR is the newest opening. Meanwhile, the Long Bar continues to dispense Singapore Slings like they are going out of style, though I doubt they ever will. The Raffles Courtyard has been transformed from a place where, as the hotel’s unflappable general manager, Christian Westbeld, put it to me, ""you might have been afraid to run into your grandparents,"" into a flexible, relaxed outdoor space where you can sip Champagne or chug beer by the bucket, as you prefer. And best of all, in my opinion, the old Writers Bar, which was barely a bar at all and hardly worth writing about, has been shifted to the front of the main building, greatly expanded and transformed into one of the most charming bars in a city that is full of charming bars.', 'What sort of person stays here?\nVery spoiled, very happy people. People who like luscious heritage hotels packed to the rafters with stories. People who could not care less about heritage or stories but who like lusciousness. And all kinds of people in between. One of \nSingapore’s\n most attractive qualities is its cosmopolitanism, its openness to the world; Raffles embodies that spirit.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nNot a bad word. The sunniness outside is eclipsed by that inside the hotel. Every guest has a butler. Mine was called Gin. I like to think that Gin will be Secretary General of the United Nations in the fullness of time. Minister of Labor and Employment in the Singaporean government at the very least. One morning she brought tea to my room and heard me addressing threatening remarks at my laptop through gritted teeth. A certain amount of deadline-related bad language might, I am afraid, have been involved. ""Sorry, Gin,"" I said, realizing what a fool I was making of myself. That afternoon, deadline met, Gin found me by the hotel’s swimming pool in a much-improved frame of mind. ""Mr. King!"" she said. ""I am pleased to see you here! A good work-life balance is so important!""', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?\n\xa0\nThere is an old saying that goes something like: ""You don’t come to Singapore and stay at Raffles; you come to Raffles and see what you can of Singapore."" All great hotels are universes unto themselves, and this one more than most. That is not, of course, a reason not to leave your room and go forth and explore the outside world. But it is a reason not to feel \ntoo\n rotten if, on your way toward the front door, you never make it past the Writers Bar.', 'Anything else?\nA note on the Long Bar. I love it. Some people do not. Make up your own mind. But what I would urge you to do is to follow the compulsory Sling (after making a few complimentary remarks to the bartender about how pleasantly different it is from the last time you were here—less sweet, less syrupy than before) with a Million Dollar Cocktail. Bizarrely, this is not even on the menu. But it was invented by the same guy who invented the Sling, Ngiam Tong Boon, in the same year, 1915. Funny, isn’t it, how people latch onto one thing and not another? The Singapore Sling and the Million Dollar Cocktail are sisters who share the same DNA and many of the same qualities but possess quite different temperaments and have gone on to enjoy different lives. One is beautiful and famous the world over; the other is even more beautiful yet content not to have to put up with all the fuss and attention.', 'And anything you’d change?\n\xa0\nSome of the contemporary artworks on the upper stories of the main building. Just four or five of them—inexplicably jarring. I have nothing against contemporary art. Love the stuff. But if those absurdities are still there on my next visit, I will remove them myself, hurl them into the Singapore River, and live with the consequences.', 'Bottom line: worth it?\nThis question is a vexed one. Worth what to whom? According to which criteria? Given the overall cost of the renovation and the number of rooms—I mean suites—it comes out, I believe, at something like $1.9 million per room. I have been coming here since I was eight years old and, based on what I have seen with my own eyes, I can say, hand on heart, that the joint has not looked better in my lifetime. Having studied piles of old photographs in the company of the hotel’s resident historian, Leslie Danker, I would venture to say that it has probably never, ever looked better in any lifetime. Ever. So. Is it worth it? Damn right it is.']","1 Beach Road, Singapore 189673, Singapore",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/singapore/dhoby-ghaut/raffles-hotel-singapore,https://www.raffles.com/singapore/

Inside is no less humble, and restaurants and bars often feel rich and handsome with dark finishes, plush chairs, and slick views.","['Set the scene.', ""Sometimes it's as simple as the old real estate mantra: location, location, location. The Ritz-Carlton is the only hotel in its class that’s plunked itself down in an actual neighborhood instead of a dedicated business district. As such, you get the best of both worlds—an international standard of service when you tuck yourself in at night, but heaps of cute cafes and boutiques to discover during the day."", 'The rooms.', 'There are two main views on offer—the Tokyo Tower view and the Mount Fuji view. Generally Japanese guests want Fuji (really only visible on clear days with low humidity—it’s far) and visitors are keen to glimpse the city’s orange version of the Eiffel Tower (a few feet taller than the real thing, for those who are keeping track.) Suites are double the size of the rooms and feel like a proper apartment in the sky; a great choice if you’re planning on sticking around for a while.', 'Food and drink.', 'Catering to heavyweight businesses lofted in the mega-complexes of Tokyo Midtown and Roppongi Hills, the Ritz-Carlton knows how to wield a business lunch: kaiseki multi-course Japanese specialties crunched down into a super sexy bento box of local delicacies from sashimi to tempura. It’s a great one-hour option if you’ve got a lot of sightseeing on your agenda.', 'Service.', 'It’s in the corporate vernacular to ask guests what they’re up for the day (or what they’ve been up to if it’s evening) and offer cherry-on-top tips like a cool park of viewpoint to tack on to one’s urban ambling. If you like a certain amount of anonymity during your hotel stay, this may not be your most favorite hospitality tactic.', 'Describe the tribe.', 'Unlike many of the other luxury hotels in Tokyo, the Ritz-Carlton has a sizable Japanese clientele—both businessmen and domestic travelers enjoying some Tokyo time. Expect to share the elevator with a lot of designer labels.', 'Neighborhood.', 'Of all the high-luxury properties in Tokyo, the Ritz-Carlton has our favorite positioning in what’s called Tokyo Midtown. The multi-use complex approximates a giant city block in New York City, but that’s not why we love it.

The 17-story tower has 84 rooms and feels more like a dozen ryokans than it does one hotel. Each floor, accessible only to guests staying on that floor, has its own central lounge—or ochanoma—for quiet relaxing with a pot of genmaicha. Every guest room is spacious with glass-walls, sliding latticed washi screens, bamboo closets, fragrant tatami mats, and supremely fluffy futons. It’s worth having dinner at the hotel’s guest-only restaurant which serves colorfully presented Nippon cuisine. Regardless of dinner location, every night should end at the open-air rooftop onsen—the reason behind the heroic drilling—for soaking while stargazing in the middle of the city.","['What was your first impression?', 'Occupying a compelling liminal space between city hotel and traditional Japanese ryokan, this pillar of tranquility rises among other glass and metal spires in the heart of Tokyo. Upon entering, the frenetic hum of Tokyo drops ten decibels as you slip off your shoes. Staff in white robes tuck each pair into bamboo and chestnut cubbies lining the long and tall entryway, and guests walk barefoot into a quiet, cleanly designed space that feels almost hallowed.', 'Backstory\n.', 'The domestic Hoshino hotel brand has become the custodian of Japanese tradition as it grows its hospitality empire across the country and beyond. This is the flagship property in their top—Hoshinoya—echelon of stay (it’s worth checking out their onsen-centric [onsentric?] four-star Kai properties, too!) where service leans deeply into the omotenashi ethos of prescribed service.', 'Room.', ""With only six rooms per floor, the idea here—as every staff member will gleefully explain—is that each level feels like its own mini ryokan inn centered around a tatami-lined tea room where sweets and snacks are readily on offer. It’s an opportunity for guests to quietly interact with one another, but we found it impossible to tear ourselves away from our room; serenity defined with low-slung furniture and a spacious bathroom that approximates a mini onsen. For those who can, the south-facing Kiku rooms at the end of the hallway are twice the size of the entry-level rooms, and their currency is\xa0 spaciousness—a rare commodity in crowded Tokyo. Large windows slip shut with shoji paper screens which, once opened, filter patterned light through the facade's patent armor: A metallic framework of the Edo Komon motif. Japanese craftsmanship moves throughout the room with ease, whether it's drawers and wardrobes embracing a bamboo weave or a loveseat poised on the floor with its arms and back made from loops of flexed bamboo."", 'Food and drink.', 'If this is your first time in Japan and you’ve just crash-landed on Planet Tokyo then the dinner service here might be too arcane for new arrivers. Courses are certainly innovative—and use French cooking methods to play with Japanese ingredients—but some of the entrees in the multi-course meal can feel like too much of a pastiche of the Japanese dinner table when you aren’t accustomed to its staples. Breakfast, however, is a great introduction to a bento-style of best-ofs: simmering fish, pickles, tamago, and a fresh pot of tea. A Western version is available too, but c’mon—when in Rome… (the staff will cajole you towards the Japanese version, too.)', 'Service.', 'If you want your service as speedy as the city’s pace, then this might not be the most ideal fit for you. Staff have mastered a certain calmness that they bring to the check-in experience; it’s important that they show you the ropes to maximize your stay, from explaining the tea-making facilities to offering gentle instruction on how to tie on one’s in-house attire. Traditional activities are enabled by certain staff members, like a tea ceremony, should you want to go down that rabbit hole.', 'Describe the tribe.', 'The one allowance for a bit of fusion is in the lounge attire offered to guests—a hybrid of Western and Japanese sensibilities—comfy shirts blend with yukata-esque robes. But you’ll be hard-pressed to come across other visitors beyond the communal tea room on your floor—and there are no public spaces welcoming non-staying visitors into the fold.', 'Neighborhood.', 'The hotel’s location—and raison d’etre—is its well of subterranean mineral water that fills the onsen’s warm baths, so the location is a bit of an afterthought. It’s one of Tokyo’s financial centers, so it clears out after dark, but the metro connections are plentiful, taking you to Shinjuku or Ginza in only 15 minutes.', ""Is there anything you'd change?"", 'The space-time continuum. So we could stay longer.', 'Spa.', 'It’s as though the whole hotel was designed to cure foreigners of their jet lag with its rooftop onsen. When warm, mineral-rich water was discovered in the Otemachi area, Hoshino laid claim to the piece of land above, building their 17-story right on top of it and harnessing the powerful healing properties of the water in their crowning hot tubs. They sit at the bottom of a chimney-like structure where you can hear the whirr of the trains and trucks (and feel the rain when it’s coming down) but the blaring the lights of the city are well hidden (you’re hidden too—bathing’s traditional here: birthday suits only.)', 'Bottom line: Worth it?

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",3,"Japan’s capital is many things—sprawling, neon-lit, nocturnal—but one word not often used to describe it is relaxing. I registered this dissonance approximately an hour after I last checked into Aman Tokyo. More precisely, while floating 34 floors above ground, inhaling and exhaling with a meditation teacher in a white space, distracted only by vivid sunset views. Aman has, of course, long been a byword for a certain kind of crisp zen wellness. Yet there’s something extra special about discovering it among the skyscrapers of a megalopolis, surrounded by the impeccable geometry of the late Australian architect Kerry Hill, who was long inspired by Japanese design and considered this one of his finest works. Aman destinations have tended to focus on nature and heritage, so transplanting the concept to the big city in 2014 was a bolder move than it seems now. The lobby still turns heads, with its towering ceiling, abstract blooms, and kimono-clad musician plucking the strings of a koto. The bedrooms are filled with always seem to me more akin to mindfulness spaces, with their aromatic hinoki-wood, sliding screens and staggered levels. The food and the service are impeccable—of course they are—but the spa is the real scene-stealer, a place of complete sensory purity that hovers unperturbed over the fizzing city.

Here, Aman spins its point of view on Tokyo, with unobstructed views of the imperial garden from high within its hotel tower. It’s a realm of immeasurable calm in a city of frenetic lights, where the resident architect—the now-deceased Kerry Hill—played with the tenets of the Japanese house, and its delineation of indoor and outdoor space in the lobby, using a bevy of natural materials. After one night here—or even just an afternoon tea—and you’ll understand why legions of luxury seekers have dubbed themselves “Aman junkies”.', 'The backstory', 'The canary in the coal mine for the entire Aman portfolio, Aman Tokyo was the first urban essay by the brand—bringing nature into the city. And, needless to say, it was a smashing success, ushering in the development of several more urban properties, namely the recently opened Aman New York.', 'Rooms', 'Oversized rooms follow Hill’s meditation on the Japanese home, with decor that’s uncompromisingly local—pared back with an attention to fine materials—in an attempt to fully seduce the senses. Slide the washi-covered door panels to reveal a stone-laid bathroom within, complete with a \nfuro\n bathtub overlooking the city.', 'Food and drink', 'The theme of intentionality continues in Aman Tokyo’s food and beverage offerings, especially at the keystone restaurant, Musashi by Aman, where the eponymous chef serves \nomakase\n-style sushi and sashimi to delighted diners from across the sweeping hinoki wood bar. Everything has been masterminded by Musashi himself, reaching far beyond the fish purchased at the market earlier that morning: on his days off he retreats to the mountains beyond Tokyo where his farms fresh wasabi and rice that not only make their respective appearances on the plate, but the rice is also used to ferment into the restaurant’s signature sparkling sake. The language barrier can be somewhat of a hurdle at times for those who don’t speak Japanese, but the incredible flavors and stunning dish presentation need no translation. Even if you’re not staying at Aman Tokyo, it’s well worth booking a table here.', 'The spa', 'Massive, sky-lofted swimming pools are par for the course in Tokyo’s luxe hotel scene, but Aman does it best, in a vaulted, stone-clad atrium some 30-plus floors above the street. The perfect escape during a rainy day, the spa feels like a spaceship navigating the gray, smoggy clouds as passengers recline on oversized daybeds under soothing lights emitted from a switchboard-like wall.', 'The service', 'Wish fulfillment is the name of the game at Aman, where any request will be heartily fulfilled; sometimes the eager anticipation of your needs can mean being asked what exact time you want your breakfast the next day even before you’ve completed your check-in, but it’s all in the spirit of proffering seamless service.', 'The neighborhood', 'In the quiet of the pandemic, the Aman Tokyo team began expanding their “Tokyo by Aman” ethos beyond their bricks and mortar, handcrafting bespoke touring opportunities in the neighboring area of Nihonbashi, home to generations-old businesses dedicated to traditional crafts. On an Aman-led excursion, guests can order custom kimono, engrave their own chopsticks, and decorate handmade fans, to name a few of the experiences.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'We can’t wait to check out the opening of Janu Tokyo, the newest Aman endeavor; a brand that puts a dedicated wellness spin on the company’s core values. The gleaming luxury property is set to open at the end of 2023 in the middle of 2024 in the Toranomon neighborhood, only a few miles from Aman Tokyo.']","The Otemachi Tower, 1 Chome-5-6 Ōtemachi, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 100-0004, Japan",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/tokyo/aman-tokyo,https://www.aman.com/resorts/aman-tokyo

Bulgari Hotel Tokyo,,3,"The decadent Bulgari Hotel Tokyo crowns the cloud-brushing apex of the new 45-storey Tokyo Midtown Yaesu tower, just opposite Tokyo Station. Against a backdrop of sultry black granite with pops of jewel tones, the deluxe hotel smoothly blends contemporary Italian design with Japanese craftsmanship and a glamorous sprinkling of Bulgari heritage. Picture hand-blown Murano lights suspended from temple-like wood ceilings; traditional Japanese textile motifs recreated in Venetian mosaic tiling; and, adorning the walls, hints photographs of celebrities visiting the Roman flagship in the 1950s, vintage advertising and jewelry sketches. The 98 guest rooms balance Japanese touches (woven bamboo wall vases, modern sliding screens, gold-flecked bed throws by Kyoto kimono textile masters Hosoo) with warm saffron fabric headboards, natural elm wood, and sexy black-granite bathrooms. Italian cuisine tapping into the minimalist essence of natural flavors is served up on Ginori plates at Il Ristorante–Niko Romito, a light-flooded 40th-floor space in layered shades of light orange textiles, copper net curtains and caramel leathers: while sushi is expertly prepared at the hinoki wood counter of the serene eight-seat Hoseki restaurant, overlooking a small Zen garden.

United Places Botanic Gardens,,3,"Among Australian cities, Melbourne rules the design and foodie game. But until now it has fallen shamefully short on the hotel front and developer Darren Rubenstein knew it. When asked advice by a friend on where to stay in his hometown, he was completely uninspired. So he decided to become a hotelier and sort it out himself. The result is a gift to his friend and anyone planning to visit Melbourne. Rubenstein enlisted architect Sue Carr to create a four-story, glass-and-concrete new-build opposite Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens in the upscale suburb of South Yarra, just 10 minutes from the city center. Of the 12 smart yet understated rooms, those in moss-green tones have views of the gardens; the others, in shades of dusky pink, overlook the neighborhood. Every detail here is carefully considered and in line with the taste level expected in this style-driven city. There are expansive balconies for relaxing with a dram of Sullivans Cove whisky, distilled in Tasmania, and a Patricia Urquiola Redondo sofa to curl up on in the living area. There’s no lobby, just a discreet entrance, and the shadows of a custom-made Laura Woodward kinetic sculpture draw you towards the lift to your room. Each morning, a seasonal breakfast (yogurt with berries and dark chocolate) is delivered at a time that suits. ","['Set the scene.\nAn almost cubist façade amid historic red-bricks and mansions, with textured concrete walls and dangling light sculptures inside, and criss-cross velvet sofas by Patricia Urquiola. Few \nMelbourne\n addresses have a location as compelling as this 12-suite hotel—a highly personal project overlooking the Royal Botanic Gardens in chic, residential South Yarra.', 'What’s the story?\nUnited Places was born after its founder, real-estate developer Darren Rubenstein, realized he never had the right hotel to recommend to friends and colleagues passing through Melbourne. So he created a space that had the best in design and food, as well as one that was sustainable and overlooking the city’s beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens. This is the first in what Rubenstein plans on developing into a small group of hotels.', 'What about the rooms?\nUnlike many Australian hotels, which lean on old-fashioned design motifs, this riffs on the best interior-design trends from Scandinavia and \nNew York\n with tactile materials such as deeply colored velvet, Italian marble, and polished hardwood. The rooms are generously sized and whisper-quiet. There are Le Labo bottles in the bathroom and organic iced teas in the mini bar. The largest suites have deep soaking tubs overlooking the treetops. An intuitive tablet takes care of most controls.', 'How about the food and drink?\nDownstairs, local hot-shot chef Scott Pickett has opened \nMatilda 159 Domain\n—a restaurant based on charcoal and wood-fired cooking—to instant acclaim: The smoked spanner crab with charred flatbread and prawn butter is already being called a Melbourne classic. Guests also get exclusive, complimentary breakfast baskets with yogurt and chocolates from Pickett.', 'Who comes here?\nGlam Australians with exceptional taste, as well as those visiting Melbourne for its strong arts and cultural scene. They wear McQueen, sip whisky, and likely have a string of rose-gold studs up one ear.', 'What about the neighborhood?\nThe hotel is about two-and-a-half miles from the CBD in South Yarra but the surrounding streets contain plenty of great independent shopping and dining. The Royal Botanic Gardens are vast, with plenty of open green space and a scenic running path.', 'Is it worth it?\nThis is one of the few truly luxurious small hotels in Australia and will delight those with cosmopolitan tastes.']","157 Domain Rd., Melbourne, Victoria 3141, Australia",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/melbourne/melbourne/united-places,http://unitedplaces.com.au/

Park Hyatt Sydney,"Gold List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Sometimes the job of a hotel is not to overwhelm or overpower but to smoothly facilitate. This, to me, is what the Park Hyatt Sydney has always done. Tucked beneath the Harbour Bridge, its sandstone exterior is unassuming, almost austere. But inside, the whole thing makes sense: Everything is geared toward the Sydney Opera House, the glinting bay, and those green-and-mustard ferries lolling into Circular Quay. None of the rooms and suites is smaller than 430 square feet, and each feels like the smartest waterfront apartment, with mirrors and deftly angled walls emphasizing space and pure Australian sunshine. The mosaic rooftop pool—almost unnoticeable from ground level—is one of the city’s great spots, and I’ve spied Bruce Springsteen reclining in the jet pool. For food, I tend to go for the more casual dining option, The Living Room, with cinematic views beyond Kirribilli Point, where a plate of local rock oysters and a Hunter Valley Chardonnay is all that’s required. Service is wonderful, in that crisply unforced Australian way, but really the Park Hyatt is about what’s outside. It is an eminently happy bubble, where it almost feels like I am floating on that shimmering ocean.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Unlike with other properties on Puerto Rico's resort-heavy north shore, Dorado Beach's emphasis is on its setting. The resort has undergone many transformations (including after Hurricane Maria in 2017), but since Laurance Rockefeller built a sanctuary here it has been all about sea, sand, and green spaces. Rooms are bookended by beach-facing terraces and outdoor showers, and museum-quality art is scattered on tree branches. But it’s the Spa Botánico, a tropical wonderland that’s much more than the usual cluster of treatment rooms, that really sticks to Rockefeller’s approach. After visiting, you’ll remember the 95-year-old ficus at the entrance most clearly. That or the tree house in the canopy where you had the greatest massage of your life. ","[""Set the scene: What's this place all about?\nThe linear palms and manicured golf greens signal that the enclave of Dorado is different from others on the island. And indeed, it is: This is a luxury gated community where crypto-millionaires spend their downtime. The Ritz-Carlton Reserve here feels removed, yet the hotel is actually more plugged-in than it appears. Wood-planked walkways, a lily pond, and curated greenery welcome guests upon arrival, while ocean views and a two-mile stretch of sand immediately instill a sense of tranquility. Upon arrival, a staffer holds out a tray of tropical popsicles as a first touch of hospitality."", ""What's the backstory?\nThis land, first developed as a pineapple, grapefruit, and coconut plantation in 1905, it didn't become a resort until 1958, when tycoon Laurance Rockefeller developed it as a hotel and nature preserve. In 2012, Ritz-Carlton transformed it into its first Reserve property in the Americas. After Hurricane Maria, the resort closed for one year, reopening in October 2018 following a multi-million-dollar renovation."", ""How are the rooms? Any tips on what to book?\nEven the entry-level rooms are huge—nearly 1,000 square feet—and all embrace the natural surroundings with ample terraces and giant picture windows offering cinematic views of the ocean, along with outdoor and beach access. Outfitted with wood and marble, the interior design's coffee and sand tones defer to the vivid greens and brilliant blues outside. Water elements are abundant; all rooms include indoor and outdoor rainforest showers along with soaking tubs; some also feature private plunge pools. Villas and residences kick up the luxury with golf carts and private chefs for hire. The extravagant 8,000-square-foot Su Casa villa, recently renovated by Champalimaud, is the preferred stay for V-VIPs."", 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nWi-Fi is included in the $125-a-day resort fee.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe resort has made a post-hurricane commitment to increase local sourcing in its four restaurants, which include Coa, a grill concept with one of the largest wine cellars in the Caribbean; the Asian-influenced Positivo, where a sand floor nods to the idea of beach-to-table dining; and the family-friendly Encanto. If you want to do some of the work yourself, guests can participate in cooking classes at La Cocina Culinary Center.', 'And the service?\n Every room is assigned an \nembajador\n, a personal butler charged with enhancing experiences. They can arrange everything from helicopter tours to private yacht bookings to family photoshoots on the beach.', 'Who tends to stay here?\nWell-heeled golfers with their spouses and families; cashed-up honeymooners whose parents paid for their room as a wedding gift; Ritz-Carlton loyalists from all over the world.', ""Where's the hotel located, and what is there to do in the surrounding area?\nWhile it feels self-contained amid its 1,400 acres, the property abuts the residential Dorado Beach Resort & Club where guests can take advantage of more amenities, including Melao, a restaurant by celebrated local chef Mario Pagan. Downtown Dorado has every shop and service vital to a thriving community."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nThe $125 resort fee seems high for a property that already has top-tier room rates."", ""Anything other features worth a mention?\nWe've been hinting at it, but Dorado is the go-to golf hub for the island. There are three pro courses, one designed by Robert Trent Jones and another by his son, Robert Trent Jones Jr. Other diversions are equally first-rate, such as the five-acre Spa Botanico, a paradise unto itself with treatment treehouses; the 11-mile Rockefeller Nature Trail, a haven for hikers, joggers, and cyclists (with free bikes provided by the property); the Watermill aquatic playground for kids; tennis courts; two pools; and watersports."", 'Bottom line: Worth it?

"Kimpton Vividora Hotel, an IHG Hotel",,1,"A nest of calm—and a very stylish one, at that—among the bustle that is the Gothic Quarter. You’re five minutes’ walk from Barcelona cathedral, even less to the thronging Las Ramblas; among the winding historic alleys and buzzy boulevards, the newly opened Kimpton Vividora is an urban sanctuary that doesn’t scrimp on rooftop chill-out scene.","[""In short: Worth it? Why?\n A nest of calm—and a very stylish one, at that—among the bustle that is the Gothic Quarter. You’re five minutes’ walk from Barcelona cathedral, even less to the thronging Las Ramblas; among the winding historic alleys and buzzy boulevards, the newly opened Kimpton Vividora is an urban sanctuary that doesn’t scrimp on rooftop chill-out scene.\nSet the scene: Why did the hotel catch your attention?\n You never know what to expect in the Gothic Quarter, such is the random nature of these streets, where hipster vintage shops rub shoulders with craft stalls, skateboarders, cannabis dealers, and about 15 branches of Zara. So, to see the Kimpton Vividora stand rather majestically down one of them—marked by huge tropical plants, an aroma of its trademark perfume, and a palette of peachy terracotta stonework—was a surprise. A really good surprise.\nWhat's the backstory?\n The Kimpton Vividora is part of the IHG Group, which spans InterContinental Hotels, Six Senses, and Crowne Plaza (among others), but—to its credit—you’d honestly never know it was part of chain. The Vividora is the Kimpton brand’s first foray into Spain, and its “hola” has been done with panache and individuality. There are some really attentive design details, such as patterned tiles on the elevator floors."", 'How are the rooms?\n Accommodation is divided into Guestrooms and Suites, and what sets them apart is the outside space you get. The upper tiers of the Guestroom category offer small Juliet-style balconies, but the Suites go big on terraces—and it’s worth it. My Executive Suite had a wraparound corner terrace that ticked off views of the W hotel, the cathedral, Torre Agbar and the top of \nLa Sagrada Familia\n. But you also get a fascinating snapshot of raw Barcelona life, stealing glances into people’s terraces and the pretty—and gritty—reality of that. Back inside the room, it does all the right things with design. The color palette has location-perfect sunset shades: tan leathers, a mustard chair, ochre bathrobes and 50 shades of clay. It feels expensive, and it smells expensive. An unexpected plus: a gigantic bathtub, beer by local microbrewery Ocean Beer, as well as sachets of sun cream in case you forgot it.', ""Food and drink: What's on offer?\n Casa de Vivi is Kimpton Vividora’s complete food and drinks experience. Designed to feel like being at a friend’s house, it starts on the ground floor, in Bar Got, with great cocktails and complimentary wine from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. every day—a smart, welcoming touch. From there, move up one floor for dinner at Fauna Mediterranean restaurant before taking the elevator – and the experience – up to the next level at Terraza de Vivi—the seventh-floor rooftop bar.\xa0You don’t so much come for the food as the experience: panoramic views, comfy seating in Instagrammable fabrics and, at the weekends, DJs, as well as brunches with limitless mimosas. You know the crowd.\\"", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The standout feature is the rooftop pool. A matchbox of a thing, really, but it’s as photogenic as the people posing on giant beanbags beside it. There’s also a small gym, and complimentary bikes and skateboards. Over the sunny months (which can span until October in Barcelona), there are free sunrise yoga classes twice a week on the roof terrace.', 'What about the neighborhood?\n Choosing to stay in the Gothic Quarter doesn’t just put you close to the action, it almost slaps you around the face with city’s densest offering of shops, bars, and full-on street life. It’s not for everyone, and ordinarily I would stay in a quieter ‘hood, such as Eixample. But the Kimpton Vividora is a marvel in that it physically puts you in that world, then calmly removes you—offering you a cocoon of a bed, rooftop cava, and some impressive sound-proofing. I could be a convert.', 'How is the service?\n Checking in is initially confusing as reception isn’t on the ground level, but one floor up. Once that’s worked out and you have someone’s attention, service is a strong point—grill them for every local tip you’ve ever wanted. The level of English spoken is top-notch.', ""What's on offer for sustainability?\n A couple of green wins in the rooms: water in cardboard packaging,\xa0vegan, cruelty-free bathroom amenities\xa0and a recycling bin.\xa0The majority of food and drinks served in the hotel are locally sourced from the Barcelona region."", 'Anything else we should know?\n The Vividora is completely pet-friendly, to the point that they only have one policy: your animal has to fit in the elevator. Since its opening in 2019, that means there’s been over 300 pets. One week before my visit, two parrots checked in.']","Carrer del Duc, 15, Barcelona 08002, Spain",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/barcelona/kimpton-vividora-hotel-an-ihg-hotel,https://kimptonvividorahotel.com/en/

"Cotton House Hotel, Autograph Collection","Gold List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2018. Readers' Choice Awards, 2019. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",2,"Smart hotels in this city often hew to a certain mod-minimal, design-agency template. The Cotton House in Eixample, though, is very different—a riot of neoclassical joy in a 19th-century cotton guild, which makes me smile every time. Interior designer Lázaro Rosa-Violán is well known for his designs across Barcelona, including the Edition—but it’s hard to think he’s ever had more fun than with the Belle Epoque features here, from its old parquet floors to the wood-paneled ceilings and grand spiraling staircases. The cotton theme runs through the orb-shaped chandeliers, like cotton flowers; the 300-thread Egyptian-cotton sheets in the more minimal rooms; and the fact that guests can order candy-colored, hand-stitched shirts from the very sharp concierge desk, which is known as the Gossypium (the Latin name for the genus of plants that produce cotton). The style is grown-up, but a chintzy wink is never far away. In the bar, which spills out onto a lushly foliaged terrace, the house Gossypium cocktail with Pisco and blue Curaçao gleefully throws out the prevailing vogue for Savoy classics. It is a reminder that hotels can grandly mine the past—but do it without taking themselves too seriously.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nCotton House Hotel is set in a historic building that dates back to the 19th century, and was first built as a private palace before being converted into the headquarters of the Cotton Textile Foundation.

Built to blur the line between place-for-tourists and place-for-locals, colossal windows thaw the barrier with local life outside. Once those doors close behind you, however, you will gasp. The ceilings stretch higher than a supermodel’s legs, walls are made entirely of books, its tropical plants could rival Jack’s beanstalk for size, and, oh my gosh, all that light. This four-star’s impact goes to a galaxy way above.\nSet the scene: Why did the hotel catch your attention?\n The first thing that catches your eye from the street is that there are so many people in it. Is it a bar? A café? A workspace? The Seventy opened during the peak co-working craze of 2019, and it understandably wanted in on the action. So, with the check-in desk cleverly tucked away to the right, the lobby—an area so often relegated to dead space—is completely alive. Friends catch-up on sofas, work meetings take place from leather armchairs around marble coffee tables, visitors study Google Maps at the circular cocktail bar. The Seventy is abuzz, and that feels wonderful.\nWhat's the backstory?\n The Seventy is part of a cult Barcelona hotel family, with siblings in \nHotel 1898\n on Las Ramblas and the Hotel Rec, a buzzy three-star by Arc de Triomf that houses the excellent \nFismuler\n restaurant."", 'How are the rooms?\n The 152 rooms span six categories, from a cosy House Room to the ultra-braggable duo of Duplex Suites, which sit splendidly on the sixth floor, all outrageous views, king-size beds and unique perks, such as access to exclusive wines. But the standard specs aren’t a case of settling. Dark blue walls, bright-white linens and monochrome bathrooms create fresh, modern sleep spaces that feel larger than they are. That the décor still has that irresistible fresh gleam of a new launch is a bonus, too.', ""Food and drink: What's on offer?\n There are two spaces to eat, both serving the same menu, and, boy, are they attractive. Outside, the Patio is a Mediterranean-infused oasis of olive trees, water features, and patterned floor tiles; inside, Kitchen & Timeless has living walls of plants and gets a stream of late-lunch sun. The menu is simple, but done well: wild mushroom croquettes, truffle risotto, and a daily fish special."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n Perks await on the upper and lower levels. The seventh-floor pool terrace offers satiation in the form of cooling dips \nand\n waiter service—for your pressing cava-and-olive needs—between 12 p.m. and 5 p.m. Downstairs, a vegan spa boasts another pool, a sauna and a steam room. Maximum vacation glow comes via the Seventy Lifting Facial, where organic cosmetics by local brand Scens are massaged in using skin-perking Kobido techniques.', 'What about the neighborhood?\n The Seventy’s location is a selling point alone. It’s on the border of village-like Gràcia, with old-time plazas and hole-in-the-wall vermouth joints, and the fancier Eixample, which houses architectural bit-hitters such as \nLa Sagrada Familia\n (just 20 minutes’ stroll away). And you’re only one block from Barcelona’s main shopping street, Passeig de Gràcia. There are local-approved eateries aplenty: tiny La Pepita across the street for tapas; Café Godot for caffeine top-ups; Ramen Yo Hiro for ramen accessed via a legendary down-the-street queue; Lo Pinyol for wine and a bite.', 'How is the service?\n Service is decent, get-the-job-done stuff. The team in the spa, and the pro bartenders—who’ll happily whip up boozy and non-boozy cocktails to your taste preferences—get a particular nod.', ""What's on offer for sustainability?\n It’s nice to see a ban on plastic water bottles here, as well as a car-sharing service."", 'Anything else we should know?\n One last thing: Desperate to see a big sports event on TV while you’re away?

The formula is deliciously simple: natural wines served with simple-but-unexpected sharing plates, such as sticky eel with cauliflower (all your sweet, smoky, BBQ fantasies in one juicy slither), leeks with pesto, and seasonal salad combos (tomato and peach, say).

In Ronda Sant Antoni?,” is what my friend said when he heard about this place. To claim that this is not the most upscale part of town is an understatement. But while you’d be advised to keep your wits about you if you are planning on wandering about after dark, there’s something refreshing about a chic hotel opening here in one of Barcelona’s grittiest downtown neighborhoods.\nThe backstory', 'The building that houses Antiga Casa Buenavista (which translates as old Buenavista house) has been in the Molleví family for a little over a century - since 1918 to be precise. Back in the 1920s and 30s it was the popular Buenavista restaurant, a meeting place for the artists and performers who frequented the area known for its theaters and cabarets. The restaurant closed in 1979 and the building became a residential block, remaining that way until 2013, when the current generation of owners decided to convert it into a boutique hotel - and to revive the old “casa de comidas”, or informal eating house, on the ground floor.', 'The rooms', 'Barcelona loves mixing historic features with modern design and this building is no exception with its original façade and contemporary interior. The rooms get plenty of natural light from the large, street-facing windows, while the top-floor suites are well worth splashing out on for their private terraces and open-air bathtubs.

But if you’re ready to splash out, the\xa0Superior Buenavista suites are well worth an extra hundred-or-so euros. Set on the top floor of the hotel, they have direct access to the rooftop pool, and, most impressively, private terraces with lots of greenery, seating and an outdoor bathtub. They sell out quickly, though, so book well in advance.', 'Food and drink', 'While the hotel is still under the radar, the same can not be said for the restaurant, which has already turned into a bit of a hotspot. Paying homage to the original Buenavista restaurant, this is a place to try the most classic of Catalan “grandma” dishes like roast chicken cannelloni or a hearty stew of baby squid with chickpeas. All the ingredients are seasonal and sourced from local producers - via the nearby Sant Antoni covered market - just like they were in the old days.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Ronda Sant Antoni sits on the border of the trendy Sant Antoni neighborhood, the considerably scruffier Raval district and the queer-friendly part of the Eixample, known as the Gaixample.

However, since pickpocketing is rife across Barcelona, you’d be advised to keep a close eye on your belongings everywhere in the city—not just here.', 'Raval is a great choice for nightlife, vintage shops and specialty coffee, while Sant Antoni is all about the hip restaurants and natural wine bars, or head up the street for some of Barcelona’s best LGBTQ+ bars and clubs.\xa0\nThe service', 'True to the boutique hotel ethos, Antiga Casa Buenavista has a genuinely friendly vibe. Staff go out of their way to be helpful without being overly deferential and there are plenty of nice touches in place, from electric scooters and mopeds (free if you choose to skip a day of housekeeping - more on that below) and walking tours of the Gothic Quarter with a certified guide every Saturday morning.', 'Eco effort', 'Sustainability is a priority here.\xa0A domotic system is in place to minimize energy use for lights and air conditioning.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"With a prime setting on Under den Linden, just a stone’s throw from the Brandenburg Gate, Hotel Adlon Kempinski is a Berlin landmark, with the most glamorous address of all the city’s five-star hotels. Coffered arched ceilings in its opulent lobby, overhauled in 2017, now feature updated lighting, which brightens and dims depending on the time of day. There are still plenty of classic details, though, including the enormous stained glass and gold leaf cupola, and the iconic elephant fountain, which was presented to the Adlon in 1930 by India's Maharajah. Rooms are classic and timeless, with wood floors, and traditional wood furnishings. There's a two Michelin-starred restaurant here too as well as the Adlon Spa by Resense, a calm, tri-level space with custom therapies and treatments, and a pool and sauna in another part of the building.","[""Start us off with an overview and an entrance.\nWith a prime setting on Under den Linden, just a stone’s throw from the \nBrandenburg Gate\n, this Berlin landmark certainly has the most glamorous address of all the city’s five-star hotels. Coffered arched ceilings in its opulent lobby, overhauled in 2017, now feature updated lighting, which brightens and dims depending on the time of day. A mix of cool gray and rich gold velvet seating and glass tables lend a modern feel to the vast, white-marbled space. There are still plenty of classic details, though, including the enormous stained glass and gold leaf cupola, and the iconic elephant fountain, which was presented to the Adlon in 1930 by India's Maharajah."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nUpscale leisure and business travelers, many of them American. You'll also see well-dressed families and, in the lobby, tourists galore."", ""How seamless is checking in, getting into your room, and all that?\n With a comfortable number of receptionists manning the front desk, check-in is a breeze. The hotel is enormous—occupying an entire block—so you'll be escorted to your room by an immaculately outfitted Lady in Red, the hotel's dedicated team of brand ambassadors."", ""Tell us more about the rooms.\nThere are a whopping 385 rooms, 78 of them suites, that vary in size and layout—and you'll pay a premium for those with Brandenburg Gate views. But the aesthetic throughout is classic and timeless, with wood floors, and traditional wood furnishings. The marble bathrooms are generous, with separate rainforest showers and bathtubs and, in the suites, a seated mirrored vanity. The Pariser Platz Suite is an apartment-sized space (900 square feet) with separate living and sleeping areas, and direct views of the Brandenburg Gate through tall windows. The three presidential suites, 2,000-square-foot setups, come with bullet-proof glass windows, a full kitchen, and 24/7 butler service. Of the three, the Royal Suite (where Queen Elizabeth II once stayed) wows with its wood-burning fireplace and grand piano."", ""Any amenities of note?\nThere aren't a lot of high-tech options in the rooms—no Bluetooth speakers or docking stations, for example. But we appreciated the ability to control everything—even the temperature—from a bedside console."", ""And what about the food? What do they have here?\nThere are two bars and three restaurants in the hotel: Quarré, with typical German cuisine; Sra Bua, which serves Japanese-Thai cuisine; and the outstanding two-Michelin-star Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer, with chef Hendrik Otto at the helm. But if you'd rather skip the formalities and hang out in your bathrobe in your giant suite, the Adlon does a small, but excellent, room service menu, complete with rolling warming carts, linen napkins, silver plate covers, and proper silverware. If you've never had lowly currywurst embellished with gold flakes, now's your chance. Another don't miss: Afternoon Tea, served weekends in the Lobby Lounge & Bar and on the second-floor Bel Etage."", ""If we've got an afternoon to spare at the hotel, where should we spend it?\nSqueeze in a massage at the Adlon Spa by Resense, a calm, tri-level space with custom therapies and treatments. There's a pool and sauna in another part of the building."", ""Bottom line: Why come here?\nYou'll get to experience what's arguably Berlin's best hotel.""]","Unter den Linden 77, Berlin 10117, Germany",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/germany/ortsteil-tiergarten/hotel-adlon-kempinski-berlin,https://www.kempinski.com/en/berlin/hotel-adlon/

This is \nCopenhagen\n’s new destination hotel.', 'Set the scene\n Villa Copenhagen’s vast, light-filled atrium lobby bar is already a popular meeting spot for locals, thanks to regular DJs, live music and pop-up events.', 'The backstory\n For owner Petter Stordalen, the self-styled Scandinavian Hotel King, the structure came first: This Neo-Baroque former headquarters of the Danish post office was built in 1912 and he has gone to great lengths and cost to preserve many of its original features. “It’s more important to me that the hotel is bustling,” he says. “It’s better that locals come by to sit and have a coffee or a beer, than we have five stars. Luxury hotels can be quite excluding, but I want a broad range of people to come.”', 'The rooms\n Compared to the vibe in the hotel’s bars and lobby, the rooms are understated and calm with natural colors, herringbone floors, and high ceilings. With train lines to the central station just outside, they are thankfully well-soundproofed as well. Inner rooms overlook the courtyard atrium, others look out across the tracks and, from some, you can glimpse Tivoli with its Wednesday and Saturday night firework displays.', 'Food and drink\n The sustainable ethos runs right through the food offerings, with carbon-free dining and zero food waste at the all-day Kontrast brasserie, but the star attraction is the in-house Rug Bakery whose pastries elevate the breakfast buffet to a very special morning treat. Mikkeller takes care of the beer selection.', 'The spa\n Uniquely for the Danish capital, Villa Copenhagen boasts a roof-top lap pool, outdoor and heated, with a bar. It’s already a popular hang-out when the sun so much as peeps out from behind the clouds.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Just across the train tracks is Vesterbro with an excellent range of independent shops and restaurants, not least in Kødbyen, the Meat Packing district. The National Museum, Glyptoteket Art Museum, Tivoli and the main shopping street, Strøget, are also within a couple of minutes by foot.', 'The service\n Low-key and informal with free-roaming check-in staff. There is a full concierge service.', 'Eco effort\n This being Denmark, sustainability is considered in everything that Villa Copenhagen does, up to and including the roof-top pool which is heated by waste energy. The Earth Suite is 100% sustainable, featuring all-recycled materials.']","Tietgensgade 35-39, Copenhagen 1704, Denmark",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/copenhagen/villa-copenhagen,https://villacopenhagen.com/

The décor consists of clean Nordic lines, hand-picked artwork, and antiques. All but one of the rooms overlook the park, and some even have fireplaces and balconies.', 'Any special amenities of note?\nTVs are Bang & Olufsen; baths feature made-in-Denmark products from Meraki.', ""Please tell us the restaurants inside the hotel are just as magical as the surroundings.\nThere's a lot of good food in Copenhagen, but with all the culinary options located onsite at Nimb, you might not make much headway. There’s fried lobster at Nimb Brasserie, open-faced sandwiches at Fru Nimb, and carrot tartare at Gemyse, an organic-vegetable haven, as well as steaks at Bar’N’Grill and whimsical whipped cream treats at Cakenhagen. After a day of sightseeing, relax beside the birch wood-burning fireplace in Nimb Bar, Gin Gin Smash in hand."", 'Anything else we should check out during our stay?\nThe Rooftop Terrace is an urban sanctuary, complete with an Italian-style, mosaic-clad pool. It reinforces the hotel’s wellness initiative, which gives guests access to a Turkish-inspired hammam, hot cardio training room, CrossFit zone, and massages and acupuncture.', ""Sum it up for us—what's the Nimb Hotel all about?\nBuilt as a castle in 1909, Nimb Hotel manages to preserve its grand Moorish past while embracing modern-day Scandinavian style, and the contrast is brilliant.

Originally designed by W. Hamilton Beattie and A. R. Scott and opened in 1902, its majestic clock tower is an icon of the Edinburgh skyline. Visitors will find the impeccable service they should expect from a Rocco Forte–owned hotel with the nice touches that often come with many old buildings, like sizeable rooms with high ceilings and ornate cornices, and proper wood-framed windows you can actually open rather than hermetically sealed plate glass. The furnishings are classic with a modern twist, the interiors elegant with grand staircases and wide corridors, and it's perfectly located for both the Old and New Towns and close to the fine Edinburgh Waverly train station. A truly beautiful five-star hotel in a truly beautiful city. ","['Start us off with the big picture. What\'s this place like? How does it strike you on arrival?\n In Gaelic, the word ""balmoral"" translates to “majestic dwelling”—and that’s exactly what The Balmoral is, with Baronial architecture style with Victorian influences and classic kilted doormen welcoming guests. Inside, Olga Polizzi\'s spaces are clean and elegant. The reception area is gorgeous, with latte-colored walls, crown moldings, ornate chandeliers, dramatic staircases, and artistic floral statement centerpieces that changes seasonally.', ""How did the Balmoral come to be?\n This hotel was originally built in 1902 for the North British Railway company; porters would take guests from their trains to an elevator that led straight to reception. Today, the hotel is the flagship property of Sir Rocco Forte's renowned luxury hotel group portfolio."", ""Okay, enough about the reception area. Take us up to the rooms—what can we expect from living accommodations?\n In a departure from the public areas, rooms are fresh and modern, with clean-lined furniture and contemporary color schemes that nod to Scotland: rustic off-whites and browns, bursts of spring green and fiery red-orange, and, in the suites, royal reds and blues. Meanwhile, tartan drapery and art depicting the Scottish countryside remind you where you are. Classic rooms—the lowest tier—aren't the most conspicuously swanky, nor are they very large; if you want the five-star experience, you'll need to splash out on one of the higher-category rooms, which have stunning city views and lofty ceilings. Some of the suites even have working fireplaces. But it's the thoughtful additions—a vanity mirror on the work desk, a free bottle of Scottish mineral water, kids' bathrobes and slippers, and adult slippers in two sizes—really set the hotel apart."", ""Sounds relaxing. Once we've settled in, we're likely to want a bit of a pick-me-up—what are our options on site?\n The hotel is a destination not just for its grandeur but for its restaurants and bars. All five venues are wonderful, but two really stand out as highlights: the Michelin-starred Number One and the Palm Court tea room. The former, led by chef Jeff Bland, turns fine Scottish ingredients into creative, seasonal dishes; the latter, arguably the visual centerpiece of the hotel, and does an award-winning afternoon tea. Whisky-lovers should stop in for a dram at the aptly named Scotch Bar, which has more than 500 bottles. The Brasserie, helmed by Alain Roux, focuses on exquisite French dishes with some good vegetarian options, too."", ""How's the service?\n Staff is five-star all the way, with everyone going above and beyond in the little ways that matter: arranging babysitters so parents can have a worry-free night, walking a guest to a shop instead of just giving her directions. Check-in is efficient and easy; occasional room upgrades are delightful, too."", ""It sounds like we'll have little reason to want to leave the hotel, but we \nare\n in Edinburgh—so how does the Balmoral fit into the surrounding neighborhood?\n The hotel's historical ties to Waverley Station—a hub for those coming and going from \nEdinburgh\n—make this hotel a vital part of Princes Street, the high street of the Scottish capital. In fact, the building's almost 200-foot-tall clock tower is set three minutes fast so guests and railway passengers don't miss their trains. There's only one exception: During Hogmanay, the city's New Year celebrations, it marks the turning of the year precisely on time."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\n The free wifi can be patchy, and at a hotel like this, high speed wifi should absolutely be free (the extortionate price per hour is frankly only justifiable if you're expensing it). And at £27, breakfast should also be included in the standard room rates; the classic rooms don't quite merit the high price without it."", ""Okay, and any other little details that helped make your stay all the more comfortable?\n Kids get their own turn-down service of milk and cookies. There's also a wonderful spa and wellness area, complete with a gorgeous lap pool, sauna, and steam room."", 'Got it. So when you get down to it, what makes this hotel so special?\n This hotel carries on the best of Edinburgh traditions while going above and beyond with 21st-century comforts.']","1 Princes St., Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/edinburgh/the-balmoral-hotel,https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/the-balmoral-hotel

Hotel guests range from hipsters and the curious to older, black-clad arty types looking for something a bit different.

And all around, huge multi-coloured spaces are filled with the quirky, humorous and risqué; a jumble of retro furnishings, artworks and curiosities to be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.\xa0\nThe backstory\nThe German-based 25hours group chose Florence as their first dip into the Italian market, hiring Milan-based interior-design darling Paola Navona to convert the vast space. She took inspiration from Dante’s Divine Comedy; the 700\nth\n anniversary of the Florentine poet’s death in 2021 hooked in with the opening.

The faint of heart may be put off by the blood red and black décor of the latter preferring the heavenly soothing blue, white and pale gray tones, but there’s no denying the sense of fun; Hell-bent guests perch on black WCs while celestial types get a set of strap-on silver angel wings to play with. ‘Large Plus’ rooms have private gardens and outside showers and the stand-alone Casetta del Giardino, with private terrace and pool, gourmet kitchen and pizza oven is a perfect crash pad for families or groups of friends. Room amenities for all include complimentary minibars (with beer, soft drinks and snacks), Bluetooth speakers, smart TVs and shopping bags. Oh, and let’s not forget the super- comfortable Simmons mattresses.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0\nGreat cocktails are served in the retro Companion Bar, but in warm weather it’s fun to grab a table in piazza San Paolino and watch the world go by. The San Paolino restaurant (a whacky flora and fauna-filled fantasy world with a vast open fireplace occupying an enclosed courtyard under a glass cupola) made big waves among the locals when it opened in spite of the rather disappointing food (which, we are told, has improved). The menu offers Italian and Tuscan favorites—beef tartare, aubergine parmigiana, fregola pasta with clams—with a particular emphasis on grilled meats that sizzle on a huge open fire. The Alimentari bar and grocery store serves up coffees, fresh pastries and cakes, pizza and focaccia all day to both hotel guests and locals.', 'The spa\nThe spa includes a Turkish bath and sauna and a private relaxation area in the garden.', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0\nIn spite of lying minutes’ walk from the designer boutiques in exclusive Via Tornabuoni, Via Palazzuolo has always had a slightly scruffy air, and the eastern stretch towards the train station is a muddle of scruffy palazzi, ethnic grocers and hairdressers, tiny bars and neighborhood trattorias.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2019.",3,"There’s no shortage of elegant hotels in Florence, but something about The St. Regis keeps me coming back year after year. It might be that, for a palazzo of 15th-century frescoes and crystal chandeliers, it is just so cozy, full of stained-glass-lit nooks in which to disappear for hours with a copy of La Repubblica. Of course, the Renaissance never feels far away. Filippo Brunelleschi, the brains behind the Duomo, designed the original palazzo in the early 1400s, and it became a hotel in 1866. If the exquisitely detailed cherubs on the ceiling of the Salone delle Feste ballroom could talk, they might tell tales that the wonderful staff here are mostly too tactful to divulge: of Botticelli and Amerigo Vespucci (the explorer who gave America its name), but also of Madonna and Keith Richards. Still, it’s not just the great and the good who are treated exquisitely: My clothes have been magically unpacked and ironed while I’ve been given tickets to skip the queues for the Diocesan Museum or Santa Maria del Fiore’s dome. Rooms, all brocades and canopied beds, mostly have views of the River Arno, while the Winter Garden restaurant is at the reverential end of Italian cooking, with dishes served under a great glass ceiling.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",2,"Old-world opulence is ingrained in this restored 19th-century mansion overlooking the Boboli Gardens. Built in 1868, the villa has been home to aristocrats from Napoleon III’s widow, Eugenie, to an Egyptian pasha, and the remarkable staff sustain this noble aura with warmth and professionalism. The 46 rooms and suites fill three buildings on the estate, with the most lavish on the piano nobile of the main villa. Though a chauffeured car is at guests’ disposal for the short ride to Florence’s center, you may never feel the need to leave Villa Cora. It has two terrific restaurants—the elegant gourmet Il Pasha and a luminous garden restaurant next to the heated white-stone pool—as well as two bars, one with an impressive selection of cigars, and a full-service spa with a sauna, steam room, and massive whirlpool bath.","['Why book?\n\xa0\nWith its setting on a leafy avenue to the south of the city, this hotel offers a taste of opulent, aristocratic living and a location that will suit culture hounds while being well removed from the crowds. The extensive pool area is a fabulous retreat on hot summer days.', 'Set the scene\nIn an area stuffed with grand villas, Villa Cora is one of the most opulent, set just above the road in a lovely garden scented with roses; inside it’s awash with elaborate stucco work and trompe l’oeil frescoes, vast gilded mirrors and chandeliers and boasts a series of reception rooms immaculately restored to their original ‘eclectic’ style. It’s an obvious venue for elaborate weddings and other celebrations, but the service and facilities also attract well-heeled types who don’t mind not being in the thick of things, and the car park is often awash with very smart cars. In summer, the pool bar is a popular evening hangout for sophisticated Florentines looking for somewhere to cool off.', 'The backstory\nFlagship of the small, Florence-based WhytheBest hotel group (which also has hotels in London, Venice and Paris), Villa Cora dates from the 1860s when it was built by Suez Canal-backer Baron Oppenheim as a gift for his wife; it was then bought by Empress Eugenié, Napoleon III’s widow. The building became a hotel in the grand style in the1960s, before being bought by WhytheBest who relaunched it in 2010 after a three-year overhaul.', 'The rooms\n44 bedrooms and suites are spread over the main villa, an ex-stable block and the very private ‘Le Follie’ in the gatehouse. If it’s opulence you are after, book into one of the suites on the first floor ‘piano nobile’ of the main villa for magnificent frescoed ceilings, antiques and four-poster beds. Rooms on the second floor are feminine, rose-themed boudoirs or you can go for a top-floor room with city views and a mod-Moroccan look. In-room treats include pink slippers, rose-embroidered robes and custom rose-scented toiletries (from Officina Santa Maria Novella) in the splendid marble bathrooms.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0\nIn-house restaurant Le Bistrot is laid out by the pool in warm weather and in the cozy Moorish Room in the villa in winter. Executive chef Alessandro Liberatore lets his creative side rip in his gourmet dinner menus (think beef tartare with chervil mayo and turbot with escabeche sauce and anchovy crumble) while at lunchtimes, there is pasta cacio e pepe, grilled filet of beef, Niçoise salad plus club sandwiches and burgers. On summer evenings, choose between the rooftop Bellevue terrace with its wraparound views or the more lively poolside Cocktail Club which is also a popular venue for sophisticated Florentines.', 'The spa\nIn the subterranean ‘Bené’ spa you’ll find a small gym plus sauna, hammam and tepidarium and a menu offering a range of both eastern and western-style massages. Beauty treatments are designed in consultation with London-based guru Sarah Chapman using delicious local Officina Santa Maria Novella products. Guests can sign up for ‘wellness’ programmes that include special menus.', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0\nThe wide, leafy avenue that winds its way from Porta Romana (the southern gate into the old city) up to Piazzale Michelangelo is awash with magnificent, aristocratic villas, and is a popular route for joggers, cyclists, dog-walkers and tourists strolling up to the Piazzale for its all-encompassing views. A short walk from Porta Romana leads into the heart of the boho-chic Santo Spirito neighborhood with its many cafés, bars, restaurants, artisan workshops and quirky boutiques. In short, the location is perfect for easy access to the city center and its sights (and there’s a free shuttle bus) while the lovely garden and pool area offer respite from the summer heat after a long day’s sightseeing.', 'The service\n\xa0\nA well-judged mix of professional, courteous, attentive and friendly. Aside from the standard activities offered by a hotel of this level (wine tasting tours in Tuscany, balloon rides over Chianti, walking tours of Florence with a private guide), there is an emphasis on putting guests in touch with local life to showcase what Florence has to offer beyond the normal tourist experience.', 'For families\n\xa0\nAside from the garden to run around in, young guests are well-catered for with tuk-tuk tours of the city, cooking and pizza-making classes, swimming and painting lessons. Toys and coloring books are on hand and the restaurant offers a children’s menu. Families can spread out and make noise without annoying fellow guests in the two gatehouse rooms.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0\nThe hotel is fully accessible and there are several adapted rooms.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0\nIn the winter, the Sunday morning brunches where buffet tables groan with food, are booked out weeks in advance.']","Viale Machiavelli, 18, Florence 50125",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/italy/scandicci/grand-hotel-villa-cora,http://www.villacora.it/en/

Each room comes with its own unique art, and many have views of the water; downstairs, restaurant Borgo San Jacopo has one Michelin star. You book this hotel for the location, but you leave feeling like you've discovered a hidden gem, one where the typical Florence tourists aren't as likely to be found and where you can escape the hectic life of the city.","['Why book?\n\xa0\nFor Ferragamo-style luxury in the Oltrarno. The sleek flagship hotel of Leonardo Ferragamo’s Lungarno Collection lies on the south bank of the river Arno, a pigeon’s spit from the Ponte Vecchio, close to many of Florence’s prime sights yet removed from the worst of the crowds.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0\nThis area of the city around the south bank of the Arno and just west of the Ponte Vecchio suffered bad damage from allied bombing during World War II and so the tall Medieval buildings that survived stand alongside non-descript blocks from the 1960s; the Hotel Lungarno incorporates both. If you want a room right on the water, this is the place; no other hotel in central Florence stands right on the river bank and the close-up views of the Ponte Vecchio are an added bonus. This area of the Oltrarno is one of huge contrasts where artisan workshops stand meters from the grand palazzi whose aristocratic owners once employed cabinet makers, picture framers, furniture painters and upholsterers to decorate their opulent homes.', 'The backstory\nThe Hotel Lungarno has long been a favorite with sophisticated international travelers, but in 1995 Leonardo Ferragamo bought the hotel and created his ‘Lungarno Collection’ which owns four hotels in Florence (all clustered around the same stretch of the River Arno) plus properties in Rome and – coming soon – Milan. This is the most ‘classic’ in feel of the group, and in spite of the sleek interiors (and a recent update) by Florentine design whizz Michele Bonan, it still retains a glamorous, vaguely retro vibe.', 'The rooms\n\xa0\nOf the 65 rooms and suites spread over eight floors, roughly two-thirds have river views; don’t even consider a room without. Ferragamo interior design-darling Michele Bonan has gone for an fresh yet elegant mod-nautical look for the rooms; blue and white striped carpeting, cream headboards, curtains and bedspreads trimmed in snappy navy, jazzy blue and white checked chair coverings. The best rooms are the ones with terraces on the river from where you can watch the early-morning scudders gliding up and down the Arno.\xa0\nIn-room goodies include Alessi kettles and Nespresso machines, mini ipads and Bosé sound systems. Sleek marble bathrooms come with generous amounts of Tuscan Soul, the in-house toiletries.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0\nBribe the maître for a coveted terrace table at sophisticated BSJ (the hotel’s gourmet restaurant) for in-your-face views of the Ponte Vecchio, a fabulously romantic backdrop for Claudio Mengoni’s assured cooking which features the sunny flavors of southern Italy thanks to a long stint working in Capri. There is an outstanding wine list, and sommelier Salvatore Biscotti can be trusted to give excellent advice.', 'Riverside Picteau Bistrot is more relaxed and serves an all-day menu of salads, club sandwiches, burgers plus the odd pasta dish. The retro American bar – with its picture windows right on the river—is a wonderful spot for a glass of fizz or a vintage Negroni. Breakfast comes with more river views.', 'The spa\n\xa0\nThere is no spa but in-room massages and treatments are available and you can have a yoga mat and weights delivered to your room.\nThe neighborhood/area\n\xa0\nThe boho-chic Oltrarno neighborhood is an eclectic mix of imposing palazzi, elegant antique shops, quirky boutiques and a plethora of cafés, bars and restaurants. Cobbled lanes and tiny pizzettas are home to artisan workshops and artists’ studios, and there is a daily produce market in the lovely Piazza Santo Spirito.', 'The service\n\xa0\nAs you would expect from the Ferragamo brand; highly professional, discreet, perfectly-pitched with some members of staff in service for years. Exclusive guest activities include the ‘Leica Experience’, a walking tour of Florence in the company of a pro photographer and his Leica cameras, and hot air balloon trips over the city.', 'For families\n\xa0\nFerragamo hotels always make an effort to keep children entertained, and the Lungarno is no exception; tailor-made activities include child-friendly museum visits and shopping trips and even visits to the football ground. There are interconnecting rooms and family suites and the Picteau Lounge has a children’s menu.', 'Accessibility\nThere are several adapted rooms and the hotel is fully accessible.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0\nThe hotel houses a magnificent collection of 20\nth\n-century prints and drawings which hang throughout the bedrooms and public spaces; spot the Picasso and the Cocteaus in the Picteau Lounge Bar.']","Borgo San Jacopo, Florence, Italy",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/italy/scandicci/hotel-lungarno-florence,https://www.lungarnocollection.com/it/hotel-lungarno/

This is, however, a Four Seasons—the original Hotel Ritz name was negotiated with the Charles Ritz chain (yes, as in, The Ritz of Paris) in the ‘50s, and dissolved when the Four Seasons took over the party in 1997. Check in is smooth—from the entrance on the slanted street, guests are whisked inside to a lobby disarmingly luscious (white marble, gilded touches) considering the exterior. The service is a dream, as are the common spaces—handwoven tapestries by Portuguese artist José Sobral de Almada Negreiros hang throughout, with ornate furnishings and happy wallpaper in a rich yellow."", 'The rooms', ""The guest rooms are newly renovated, but would look right at home in an episode of \nMad Men\n—and Don Draper in particular would appreciate the wood-paneled mini bar.

From here, head to the pool (more on that later), where Mediterranean cuisine and cocktails are served from 11 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Once you've soaked up the sun to your satisfaction, consider a snack or drink at lobby institution Ritz Bar—there's a sushi counter—before heading to Michelin-starred Cura for dinner. The 13-course Origens tasting menu is obviously the highlight here, with the seafood chawanmushi a standout amongst standouts, but I was particularly delighted by the non-alcoholic pairing options—savory, delicious juices made exclusively with waste ingredients from the kitchen."", 'The spa', ""En route to the pool (indoor and out), you'll pass the bottom-floor spa—it's a classic, utterly tranquil facility with a color palette of cream and dark wood.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Founded in 1812, frequented by Queen Victoria and listed by 1878’s influential Baedeker’s guide as “the first hotel in London,” Claridge’s could easily rest on its storied laurels. But it has always kept ahead of the rest, enlisting the likes of Guy Oliver and Diane von Furstenberg for face-lifts over the decades to ensure it bestrides the classic and modern in a way few hotels manage. The lobby captures the art deco glamour of the Jazz Age when flappers hobnobbed with royalty. Its checkered-floor expanse buzzes with an international motley crew of Hollywood stars, brides and business types catching up over zesty Ginger John cocktails in the 1930s-style Fumoir bar. The pick of the new suites is the Georgian, an impeccable meld of English heritage and subtle chinoiserie. There’s a Steinberg baby grand piano, silk de Gournay panels in the dining room and a kitchen with a 24-hour butler. The hotel’s expansion into the next-door building created space for suites such as the Mayfair, where designer Bryan O’Sullivan (The Berkeley Bar) has ingrained modernity through scalloped mohair furniture in coral and pastel-green palettes. Claridge’s has also dug deep to impress guests with its subterranean spa. Designed by André Fu (the Maybourne Bar in Beverly Hills), its limewood and stone textures and dreamy peachy hues are the backdrop for bamboo-stick massages and Cryo Oxygen Shot facials. The pool ripples beneath a vaulted ceiling, surrounded by stone columns and cushy cabanas. Claridge’s is no longer the only show in town, but it’s with good reason that every other heritage hotel in London still sees it as the benchmark. Noo Saro-Wiwa","['Why book?', 'One of the best hotels on earth, the stuff of legend. There’s simply nothing else like it. No other hotel combines the storied grandeur, the art deco stylish decor, the roster of legendary visitors, and \nthat\n afternoon tea. A peep into its lobby will seduce even those with an aversion to old-school grandeur. This is a place that wears its grandeur lightly and keeps things classic yet modern.', 'Set the scene', 'The lobby still captures the art deco glamor of the Jazz Age when flapper girls once hobnobbed with European royalty. You feel an instant buzz on entering its chequered-floor expanse, frequented by an international motley crew of flower-tossing brides, Hollywood stars, and business visitors catching up over Paper Plane cocktails in the Thirties-style Fumoir bar nearby.', 'The backstory', 'After starting life as a terraced house hotel in 1812 it was bought by Mr and Mrs Claridge, and later sold to the founder of the Savoy hotel in 1894. During the 1920s it became an English institution, attracting royalty and Hollywood stars. Apparently during World War II, when a number of European monarchs were living in exile in London, people would ring up the hotel’s switchboard and ask to be put through to the king. To which the operator replied: ‘Which one?’', 'The rooms', 'The 269 rooms and suites come in traditional or art deco style. The smallest category, the superior queen rooms, come in with mellow tones and geometric lines, and face either courtyard or Brook Street. All rooms have Dyson supersonic hairdryers and free wifi.', 'The suites feature balconies overlooking Brook Street. In the 210-square-meter Georgian suite, Michelle Wu has devised an impeccable meld of Victorian heritage with a light touch of chinoiserie. There’s a Steinberg baby grand piano in the living room, embroidered silk de Gournay panels in the dining room, a fully-equipped kitchen and a 24-hour butler. Claridge’s expansion into the neighboring building created space for suites such as the Mayfair where interiors maestro Bryan O’Sullivan has infused his modern style through scalloped-shaped, mohair furniture in coral and pastel green palettes. The marble bathroom toilets are all-singing, all-dancing affairs, with jet sprays and heated seats.', 'Food', 'Culinary Director Simon Attridge oversees a reassuring, something-for-everyone range of European classics at the two main eateries, Claridges Restaurant and The Foyer, which are destination restaurants. Dishes range from caviar or rock oysters (teamed with cranberry, spiced pumpkin and classic sauces) to Dover sole meunière, Cornish lobster bisque, black truffle arancini, seared scallop, loin of venison and chocolate bombs for dessert.', 'The Afternoon Tea’s world-famous reputation is still deserved. Savory and sweet, from smoked salmon sandwiches to sweet pastries and scones accompanied by Rodda’s Cornish clotted cream. The tea itself—hand-picked from across the world, and hand-prepared—includes bespoke Claridge’s blends prepared by Henrietta Lovell of the Rare Tea Company.', 'The new ArtSpace Café, designed by John Pawson, has its own dedicated entrance on Brook’s Mews. It serves breakfast and salads until 3pm, plus toasties, crêpes, sandwiches, pastries and artisan coffee. As its name suggests, there’s also a gallery of rotating exhibitions', 'Drinks', 'Forget about the world outside and lose yourself in the cosy, darkwood interiors of the 1930s-style Fumoir while sipping on their vintage, signature cocktails amid atmospherically dim lighting. And if the Fumoir is full, there’s Claridge’s Bar which serves spirits and rare champagnes.', 'Neighborhood/area', 'Quiet Mayfair scores nil points for cool and trendy, but those wanting a chocolate-box vision of London full of elegant Georgian townhouses, refined restaurants and Savile Row shops can get their full fix here. The Connaught and Berkeley hotels, both run by the same outfit, the Maybourne Hotel Group, are nearby.', 'The service', 'From the concierge to the toilet attendants, happiness radiates from the impeccably trained staff who exude an easy friendliness as if they’re greeting old friends, not guests.', 'Spa', 'Not content with growing sideways, Claridges has also dug deep—120 feet to be precise—to impress guests with its gorgeous, 7,000 square-foot subterranean spa. Designed by André Fu, its limewood and stone textures and dreamy peachy hues are the backdrop for signature bamboo-stick massages and Cryo Oxygen Shot facials in one of its seven treatment rooms. Visitors get to wear floral pink kimonos, and there’s also a sauna, steam rooms, changing rooms and a spacious fitness centre. The swimming pool ripples beneath a vaulted ceiling and is surrounded by stone columns and cushy cabanas. The fitness centre is well-equipped and spacious.', 'Eco effort', 'There are the small but vital protocols such as no longer cleaning bed linens and towels daily (guests are asked if and when they want them laundered). No single-use plastic cutlery or glassware is used on our site. Unused guest toiletries are decanted for use in staff changing rooms. Claridges also works with The Felix Project to donate all unconsumed food to charities, schools and food banks.', 'Accessibility', 'The few steps at the entrance are surmountable in a wheelchair but there’s also a ramp to the right. The restaurant, bar and reception areas are all flat, and there is elevator access to all floors. Many bathrooms have adaptable features, including shower seating.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'This is one of the greatest hotels you’ll ever experience.

Barely a week after its September soft opening, the place was already busy with an international crowd, between the columns and chandeliers, overlooked by London Parks murals by wallpaper specialists De Gournay. The 190 rooms were designed by American Peter Marino, all with a prevailing sense of haute-generic seven-star neutrality but are set apart by elaborate technology and extreme comfort. Bright walls of china plates and delicate cups are the backdrop to Pensinsula veteran chef Dicky To’s dishes at The Canton Blue, which fuse Cantonese techniques with British ingredients.

And then there's the faintly Jetsons-styled rooftop bar and restaurant, with knockout London views from the terrace, rare Cuban cigars and classic British food by former Bibendum and Hibiscus head chef Francesco Di Benedetto.","['Why book?', 'Its walls were reportedly built to withstand practically anything that nature or man could throw at them, and the Dorchester’s reputation as a \nLondon\n institution is similarly robust.', ""What's the backstory?"", 'Part of the Dorchester Collection (which also includes 45 Park Lane, Coworth Park and Le Meurice among others), this hotel is a grande dame that has remained utterly relevant. Located on Park Lane, overlooking Hyde Park, it’s as central as it gets.', 'Behind the scenes', 'Whether or not it’s entirely to your taste—one look at The Promenade just after you enter should be enough to make up your mind—there’s no denying this hotel’s wow factor. Everything here is scaled up: there are bouquets the size of hot-air balloons in the lobby, quilted-brocade sofas dwarf the loftiest of guests and marble-effect pillars tower over diners taking afternoon tea. The Grade II-listed building exudes old-school glamor; Prince Philip held his stag do here, Elizabeth Taylor had trysts with Richard Burton in the Harlequin Penthouse (where the pink marble bathroom was installed specially for her) and cabinet ministers holed up here during the Blitz.', 'The rooms', 'There is an impressive variety among the rooms—from the impeccable 1950s time-capsule apartments by Oliver Messel to classic chintz to smoothly contemporary. A number of suites overlooking Hyde Park have been designed by Alexandra Champalimaud; each has furnishings inspired by a cosmopolitan collection of influences, echoing the British fondness for filling homes with mementos from a lifetime of travel. With classic pieces from some of Britain’s best craftsmen, it adds up to an all-new luxury look. The one-bedroom Park Suites and Dorchester Suites (these can be linked with a further two bedrooms) have gorgeous green views and deliver a classic English stay at this classic English hotel.', 'The restaurant and bar', 'The Dorchester has two of the best restaurants in town (Alain Ducasse and the Grill), one of the most enduring nightspots (China Tang) and one of the best bartenders (the ageless Giuliano Morandin). Plus, there’s The Promenade, a great spot for afternoon tea (huge throne-like chairs and Chesterfields to sink into, a pianist gently tinkling away and the heady scent of lilies filling the air), a casual coffee or a late-afternoon cheeky glass of Champagne with oysters.', 'Who stays here?', 'Royalty, rock stars, Hollywood A-listers. It’s also popular with visitors from the Middle East, who decamp here for the summer with inconceivable numbers of designer suitcases.', 'The service', 'Among the gold-star concierge services, Martin Burrell, an Olivier Award-judging panellist and manager of the theatre desk, is legendary—if you want a ticket for a sold-out show he is the man to magic one up. And the spa inspires fanatical loyalty.', 'Neighborhood', 'In terms of proximity to London’s landmarks, the Dorchester’s Park Lane location is unrivalled: close to Mayfair, Bond Street, Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and the museum mile. Explore the warrens of Mayfair, Burlington Arcade for leather and jewellery, Shepherd Market for lovely little restaurants such as Kitty Fisher’s and Mount Street Gardens for a hidden oasis right in the heart of London’s hustle and bustle.']","53 Park Ln, London W1K 1QA, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/the-peninsula-london,https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/london/the-dorchester/
"Nomad London, Covent Garden","Hot List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Despite the Ace Hotel’s departure from the city, there’s something of a USA revival going on in London, with The Standard landing in King’s Cross and the Mondrian just launched in Shoreditch. And earlier this year, the first NoMad outside the States opened in a palatial former magistrates’ court opposite the Royal Opera House. It came with some expectation – after all, the original put a whole New York City neighbourhood on the map, its Dirty Martini-fuelled bar an overnight sensation – but has hit the ground running. The centrepiece restaurant, in a luminous, almost neoclassical atrium draped with greenery, was booked up for weeks, a see-and-be-seen destination. There’s plenty of showmanship here, but it’s more Noël Coward than PT Barnum: vintage chandeliers, brass and crimson, mohair and damask, mural painters from the opera house involved in the decor. In the bedrooms, bathrooms nod to golden Twenties Art Deco and the main spaces to a sort of transatlantic connoisseur spirit, with big-brushed abstract expressionism propped up on the floor, Hopi kachina dolls beside the fireplace and a blend of Victoriana and art history on the walls (we perhaps have hotelier Andrew Zobler’s grandmother, who owned an antiques shop, to thank for this). The Library bar has shelves and shelves of books, though the prominent criminology section can’t match a tour of the adjacent new Bow Street Police Museum, birthplace of London’s first force, which has seen the Krays, Oscar Wilde and Emmeline Pankhurst pass through its cells. Shakers rattle like sidewinders in the tavern-esque Side Hustle, mixing up fancy American-style cocktails. This is a big-thinking but surprisingly intimate hotel that deserves a standing ovation.","['Why book the NoMad?\nWhen the original NoMad opened in \nManhattan\n back in 2012, New Yorkers instantly fell in love. Here was a place that really \ngot\n their city, the boutique hotel come of age. It kickstarted a whole neighborhood—north of Madison Square Park—and its bar became a rendezvous darling, stirring Dirty Martinis with aplomb. By comparison, Covent Garden has been more or less fashionable for centuries, but NoMad will pin a new centre of gravity here. This is a big-thinking, blockbuster hotel in \nLondon\n that knows how to have fun. And as the city emerges out of lockdown, it seems to crystallize the renewed optimism and energy of the capital. Maybe the Roaring Twenties can begin again here.', 'Set the scene\nJust across the road from the neoclassical oomph of the Royal Opera House—and only a little more modest in scale with its etched Portland-stone façade—the NoMad is set in a former court. There’s a sense of occasion without the grandeur. Box-fresh white trainers on lobby staff; gold and black silk jackets in the library bar. From around five o’clock, a noise begins that many haven’t heard for a while—gradually rising in volume, it sounds a little like theatre stalls before curtain up: the sound of expectation. Centre stage is the courtyard restaurant, a three-story glass atrium rising like a Victorian greenhouse, dressed with hanging plants. Daylight paints the space in shifting watercolor hues. A catwalk leading from the lobby to the bedrooms forms a balcony for people-watching. The restaurant’s been booked out for weeks; half of London is champing at the bit to land a seat. It’s been a long time.', ""What's the story?\nPull up a pew—there’s a lot of history. Until 2006 this was the Bow Street Magistrates’ Court, dating back to the days when half the places round here were gin shops. Author Henry Fielding was a magistrate; Oscar Wilde, Emmeline Pankhurst and the Kray Twins were tried here, Vivienne Westwood too, for a punk-era breach of peace in 1977. Carriages once drove through the 13ft-high entrance, dropping off prisoners in the courtyard. To one side was the Bow Street Police Station, home to the city’s first police force, known as the Bow Street Runners (surely there’s a Netflix series in that?). It’s a heritage that appealed to Andrew Zobler, founder of the Sydell Group, who had launched the NoMad in New York in a 1920s-era Beaux Arts building. Two more NoMads followed, in L.A. and Las Vegas, along with a pair of LINE hotels and the big and boisterous Ned in London, in collaboration with Soho House’s Nick Jones."", 'For the first NoMad outside the States, Zobler brought in the design team of Roman and Williams—whose resume includes the Ace hotels, the new British Galleries at New York’s Metropolitan Museum and \nZoolander\n (\nZoolander\n! Give me the Blue Steel!)—to completely reimagine the space. The courtyard was sunk by several feet, creating a dramatic focal point for the restaurant, and the Magistrates’ Court turned into a ballroom, painted with a moody cloudscape mural that wouldn’t be out of place in the National Gallery down the road. There’s a sense of theater throughout, draped with velvets, mohair and damasks, brass and crimson, lit by vintage chandeliers. Studio be-poles, working with scenic painters from the opera house, have dressed the interiors with art works and antiques. And as for the first ever police station, it’s now a museum, with cells and offices turned into gallery spaces telling its story. Spend a little while in the infamous drunk tank and consider how a Friday night here would be considerably different to a Friday night in a bedroom at the hotel.', 'What can we expect from our room?\nThe Royal Opera Suite is worthy of a standing ovation, of flowers thrown across its herringbone parquet. The opera house itself is close enough for the high notes to shatter the Old Fashioned glasses in the cocktail cabinet. Lie in the bath and you can look across at its Grecian magnificence, its portico etched with classical myths and the gurning masks of tragedy (don’t take it personally). Artworks are set all around, a jumble of pencil sketches, photographs, oils and exhibition posters (Pollock at the National, Frankenthaler at the Lincoln Center) and portraits of eminent, mutton-chopped Victorians. One enormous frame holding a bold black abstract swirl is propped against the wall. Overhead, a glass chandelier; underfoot, faded oriental rugs. The claw-footed bath peeks out from behind a claw-footed screen; in the sitting room is a sofa the color of a peach Bellini; on the desk, a dandelion clock trapped inside a glass paperweight.', 'The bathroom has a golden aura, a Twenties-style bubble of rippled glass, mosaic tiles and lamps of the sort Mae West would emerge from underneath in a mink dressing gown. Of course, not \neveryone\n will be booking the Royal Opera Suite, but this room was the template for the others, so you will find elements of this in all of them. And each reflects the mix of Twenties Art Deco, velvety Victoriana and gritty New York abstract expressionism that the hotel has gathered together without it seeming incongruous. Other rooms of note are the duplex 237, a favorite of Andrew Zobler’s, with its original fireplace and circular chandelier connecting the two floors, and the series of former cells, with tiles, grills and signs advising on using the loo.', 'How about the food and drink?\nForks hover mid-air when fresh arrivals walk down the circular staircase to the main restaurant— this is London’s new see-and-be-seen destination, but the food is worth coming for too. NoMad has long been associated with star chef Daniel Humm, but the two are no longer working together; instead the group’s New England-born Ashley Abodeely has taken the reins, bringing over many of her New York team but also inviting Guy Palmer-Brown (of Clove Club and The Fordwich Arms) to take on wine duties. NoMad regulars will be familiar with dishes such as the roast chicken for two (a meal in three parts: egg starter in a ceramic rooster, chicken stuffed with brioche and Parmesan, peach sundae) and the tender suckling pig served with wild greens. But other plates are new, and aimed at all-day dining. Miso flatbread and pea hummus is surprisingly moreish; the seafood platter is a still life of briny freshness, five delicate mouthfuls of customized oyster, mussel, crab with avocado, and caviar, lobster tail and scallop ceviche; the turbot on bone well cooked and vibrant with a green-curry sauce. In the leather-clad Side Hustle—railway-bar style, \nBrooklyn\n hubbub, Martin Parr police shots on the wall—the menu steers west, with an accomplished Mexican menu of barbacoas, tacos and tostadas, and strong mezcal cocktails. Try the Black Dahlia, which throws in bourbon for good measure. A subterranean cocktail den, Common Decency, will open further down the line.', 'Anything to say about the service?\nSeveral key members of staff have worked with NoMad before, in New York or L.A., so know the drill; others have adopted the same sense of unintrusive attentiveness, and even with a slight opening-week glitch in the kitchen remained unflappable.', ""What's the neighborhood scene like?\nThere’s a little place opposite called the Royal Opera House that serves as a useful marker for the NoMad. A guest could down a bottle of fin-de-siècle absinthe, run blindfolded around the streets, then still easily find their way home to the hotel. Covent Garden has many other well-known sights: the London Transport Museum, the Market and Piazza, and all those little independent shops and restaurants (favourites include Aram for lighting, Magma for ’zines, Paul Smith on Floral Street, naturally, and the menus of Cora Pearl, Cafe Murano and 26 Grains). One of the city’s newest museums, of course, is the Bow Street Police Station in the same building as NoMad. There are other hotels in the area—the recently opened, Parisian-accented little Henrietta being the most interesting (hard to get excited about One Aldwych or ME Melia, while the Starck-designed St Martins Lane is far from its glory days)."", 'Is it suitable for families?\nThis is quite a grown-up hotel, though budding Eloises would find a lot of material. And if you’re nine years old, staying in one of the former cells would be huge fun. There’s plenty on the menus— burgers, hot dogs, pasta dishes—to satisfy. Several rooms can be interconnected. And Covent Garden itself has endless distractions.', ""What's its accessibility like?\nThere’s good access all around the ground floor and main restaurant, with several bedrooms available as DDA compliant rooms and a fully accessible bathroom for restaurant guests."", 'Anything left to mention?\nYou know how some places buy books by the yard and plonk them upside down on shelves in the bar in an attempt to appear well-read? Well, the NoMad has its own curated library bar with a floor plan on the menu. So before ordering, say, a Diplomat (double vermouth, maraschino, grapefruit bitters) you can head to the Music section and find a book on Iggy Pop, refamiliarize yourself with Genet and David Hare in Theater, or just aim straight for \nAmerican Modernism: Graphic Design 1920–1960\n.

Broadwick Soho,"Hot List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"This Martin Brudzinski-designed hangout on the corner of Berwick Street and Broadwick Street is no elegant grand dame or glassy international transplant. Instead, the 57-room hotel owned by a group of friends throws patterns (leopard print, zebra stripe, geometric lines), textures (cork panelling, glitter DJ booths, silk walls) and colours (flamingo pink, maroon, aquamarine) together to create a joyful place to stay. As is Brudzinski's way, spaces here are hardly shy and retiring. The designer's trademark maximalist vibe naturally draws comparisons to his other projects, especially Annabel's, but Broadwick is her own person entirely. Two enormous elephants hover above the street-level entrance in top hats and bow ties, while bedrooms pick up the motif and run with it by placing handcrafted Jaipur elephant mini bars front and centre and decking the walls in shimmering elephant-print wallpaper. A hotel this fun, of course, needs sharp public spaces for merrymaking: Flute is the disco-chic rooftop bar; Dear Jackie is a sultry, dimly lit restaurant with an impeccable Sicilian-inspired menu; and little sister Bar Jackie is a more casual café with strong coffee for soothing weary heads the morning after the night before. Then there's The Nook, a guests-only den for nightcaps or afternoon snoozes. The result is a hotel that feels fresh while simultaneously fitting right into the London scene; a space that trades heavily on its glamour and distinctly Soho soul. —Sarah James","['Why book the NoMad?\nWhen the original NoMad opened in \nManhattan\n back in 2012, New Yorkers instantly fell in love.

A subterranean cocktail den, Common Decency, will open further down the line.', 'Anything to say about the service?\nSeveral key members of staff have worked with NoMad before, in New York or L.A., so know the drill; others have adopted the same sense of unintrusive attentiveness, and even with a slight opening-week glitch in the kitchen remained unflappable.', ""What's the neighborhood scene like?\nThere’s a little place opposite called the Royal Opera House that serves as a useful marker for the NoMad. A guest could down a bottle of fin-de-siècle absinthe, run blindfolded around the streets, then still easily find their way home to the hotel. Covent Garden has many other well-known sights: the London Transport Museum, the Market and Piazza, and all those little independent shops and restaurants (favourites include Aram for lighting, Magma for ’zines, Paul Smith on Floral Street, naturally, and the menus of Cora Pearl, Cafe Murano and 26 Grains). One of the city’s newest museums, of course, is the Bow Street Police Station in the same building as NoMad. There are other hotels in the area—the recently opened, Parisian-accented little Henrietta being the most interesting (hard to get excited about One Aldwych or ME Melia, while the Starck-designed St Martins Lane is far from its glory days)."", 'Is it suitable for families?\nThis is quite a grown-up hotel, though budding Eloises would find a lot of material. And if you’re nine years old, staying in one of the former cells would be huge fun. There’s plenty on the menus— burgers, hot dogs, pasta dishes—to satisfy. Several rooms can be interconnected. And Covent Garden itself has endless distractions.', ""What's its accessibility like?\nThere’s good access all around the ground floor and main restaurant, with several bedrooms available as DDA compliant rooms and a fully accessible bathroom for restaurant guests."", 'Anything left to mention?\nYou know how some places buy books by the yard and plonk them upside down on shelves in the bar in an attempt to appear well-read? Well, the NoMad has its own curated library bar with a floor plan on the menu. So before ordering, say, a Diplomat (double vermouth, maraschino, grapefruit bitters) you can head to the Music section and find a book on Iggy Pop, refamiliarize yourself with Genet and David Hare in Theater, or just aim straight for \nAmerican Modernism: Graphic Design 1920–1960\n. Off-duty sleuths (or lags) may gravitate to the dastardly true-crime shelves. For some peculiar reason, fellow guests seemed more intent on reading the cocktail list than the books, the fools.']","28 Bow St, London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/1-hotel-mayfair,https://www.thenomadhotel.com/london/

Most rooms are understatedly plush, painted an elegant blue that’s on the sensual side of Edwardian; former Arbutus chef Alan Christie hits the key modern British notes in the dining room.

They hired interior designer Natalia Miyar, known for residential projects (but no hotels), to give the place a sensual makeover, heavy on blues and reds—with chapeau-tips to 18th-century\xa0\nFrance\n, but a prevailing sense of tactile modern luxury. To bring new life to one of London’s less-hurried quarters, Mirtorabi and Reuben brought in managing director Darius Namdar, an alum of Chiltern Firehouse, Mark’s Club, and\xa0\nAnnabel’s\n, who has clearly learned a thing or two from his old bosses Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. When we meet in the basement club, he emphasizes the personal service from the cool multicultural staff and the fact that the team didn’t want to “over-egg” the concepts.

There are Pierre Frey fabrics, black rotary dial phones, and some of the most enticing minibars in town (2014 Napa Valley Mt Brave, Diplomatico rum, You + I kombucha, Charbonnel et Walker truffles). Gowns and slippers come with smart blue trims and the curving serif font of The Twenty Two’s quietly cool branding. Things are dialed up in various suites, like a Terrace Suite with a red and black scheme that nods to Napoleonic uniforms and Christian Dior’s Parisian apartment. We stayed in the cocooning Art Studio, with its elongated bedroom entirely covered in a Mughal-inspired reddish wallpaper that’s as libidinously floral as anything Georgia O’Keeffe ever imagined. With nude pencil drawings, and everything smelling fabulously expensive, it’s hard to think of a sexier room in London.', 'Food and drink', 'Former Arbutus chef Alan Christie hits the key modern British notes in the blue mod-Edwardian dining room: from langoustines in seaweed butter to classic Dover sole and a grass-fed steak that’s almost like foie gras on the nose. The food’s excellent in an unobtrusive sort of way, but what was most notable on our mid-May visit, on a Friday night soon after opening, was how full and well-staffed the place was (what staffing crisis?). Also, how the diners felt a few shades more bohemian than most Mayfair crowds. The vibe is similar in the low-lit member’s cocktail bar on the other side of the lobby (try the Serendip Champagne cocktail), with female staff in halter-neck jumpsuits.

There’s the genteel loveliness of the oval gardens and just enough of a buffer between here and Oxford Street. If more quintessential heritage hedonism is required, some of London’s great institutions are unobtrusively dotted around the place—Scott’s, Le Gavroche, Annabel’s, and the rest.', 'The service', 'Probably the most impressive thing about The Twenty Two.

Little touches are on point and smartly straddle generational divides—like being offered a broadsheet at breakfast, Vienna-style, but then being served a Melbourne-standard flat white.', 'Who comes here?', 'In the restaurant, there were a few tables of fabulous luvvies, and a couple of what looked like art dealers in conspiratorial chats. Heading for the member’s area, we spied a new sort of young monied set: way more global than the Sloanes, and with more MBAs. Also, the sort of shimmery, sequinned types you might find at Chiltern Firehouse. Some hard-to-discern relationships. Excellent people-watching, in other words.', 'For families', 'God, no. This is a place to escape the family; quite literally a grown-up’s club.', 'Eco effort', 'We couldn’t spy many single-use plastics—but, like a lot here, it’s suggested rather than shouted about.', 'Accessibility for those with mobility impairments', ""This still has the bones of the original building, with narrow doorways (and heavy doors), narrow corridors, and plush carpets.

"The Mayfair Townhouse, Mayfair","Hot List, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",2,"The brains behind classic country-house hangouts Cliveden and Chewton Glen have whisked up a sharp new city offshoot for any of their loyal troupe of guests wanting to overnight in a London hotel. But there’s no whiff of a rural familial connection. Instead, the Half Moon Street address pays tribute to the frilly artistic folk of the 19th century: there’s a playful dose of Alice in Wonderland meets The Importance of Being Earnest (the play is set on the same street), with nods to the flamboyance of Oscar Wilde’s characters and quirky coloured graphic art referencing motifs from down the rabbit hole. It could all add up to something distinctly gimmicky but a sense of restraint and a Claridge’s-like appreciation for Art Deco has resulted in rooms that are moody, masculine and smart. Some have a tiny quiet garden terrace to retreat to—a rare thing indeed for central London – while others major in marble. The building spreads grandly across 15 converted Georgian houses, a few Grade II-listed, and a lucky handful of the jewel-toned suites come with views over leafy Green Park below. But the real high point is The Dandy Bar on the ground floor—a shiny mirror-and-plush-leather speakeasy serving up a smooth menu of cocktails alongside dishes such as chicken cobb salad and steak frites. If you can prise yourself off your bar stool, Shepherd Market with lovely Kitty Fisher’s restaurant is just around the corner, the Royal Academy is a brisk 10-minute walk down Piccadilly and 5 Hertford Street is a late-night stumble away. A brilliant new spot in a location that already knows how to have fun.","['Set the scene\n Walking into The Mayfair Townhouse feels like entering a jewelery box – mirrored ceilings, golden front desks and a shiny peacock sculpture in the lobby covered in 25,000 Swarovski crystals. The staff have named him Alfie after \nOscar Wilde\n’s secret lover, in homage to the history of the townhouse and its status as an inspiration for Algernon Moncrieff’s bachelor pad in Wilde’s most famous play \nThe Importance of Being Earnest\n. The building runs the length of 15 converted Georgian homes–some Grade II listed–on Mayfair’s Half Moon Street behind Shepherd Market–once a colorful haunt for bachelors, bohemians and artistic types including, frequently, Wilde himself.', 'What’s the story?\n This is the fifth property from Iconic Luxury Hotels, the group behind classic country house \nCliveden\n and spa destination and treehouse playground \nChewton Glen\n, as well as Cotswolds bolthole The \nLygon Arms\n and elegant Chelsea boutique \n11 Cadogan Gardens\n. Their brand new opening, however, is a little less country home and more sophisticated city crashpad – a sparkly, sultry alternative to afternoon-tea-sipping Cliveden. Although the buildings date from 1730, the hotel’s personality and design reflects the artists and writers of the late 19th century. Flamboyant and bold characters from Wilde’s fantastical storytelling, such as Algernon Moncrieff, are seen all over the walls – kaleidoscope branding, brightly colored graphic art and the mischievous hotel mascot of the fox that leaps across a mural or is stealthily perched on each guest room door.', 'What can we expect from the rooms?\n They certainly are impressive. Contemporary in aesthetic but with bold touches such as metallic glass pendant lighting, free-standing tubs and marble everywhere, some bedrooms have views over the Victorian rooftops; others of leafy Green Park down the road. Some ground-level suites have their own miniature gardens while lovely touches in the penthouse suites include dramatic sapphire-blue tufted headboards, his-and-hers sinks and a mini bar stocked with cucumber and watermelon and Bloody Mary soda mixers by UK brand Double Dutch. The larger rooms are enormous, with separate living rooms to settle down in for an afternoon of snacking on fluffy macarons and AR Lenoble Brut Champagne.', 'How about the food and drink?\n The Dandy Bar is the beating heart of the hotel. An artfully lit saloon with a curated list of cocktails and a classic all-day menu open to all. Beeline for seats at the counter and ask Piero, dressed in the most beautiful red-velvet blazer, to lead you through the signature drinks, a Mr. Bosie (the nickname of Wilde’s beau), for example, is made with Belvedere Heritage vodka and Bombay Sapphire gin, topped up with house Champagne cordial, ‘Abbotts Bitter Edible Paint’ and an Artemisia jelly cube – bitter yet subtly refreshing. Fluffy artichoke croquettes and salty edamame pair well with the drinks before mains of lobster curry or 30-day-aged sirloin. The downstairs Club Room, where breakfast is served, is busy with local freelancers grabbing coffee and is filled with bright-red and mint-green walls adorned with delicate butterflies, vintage books and golden hand-painted murals. There’s also the Den, the nook just off the dining room, which is designed with black tufted banquettes and fox-filled art on the walls – it has an air of sophisticated members club but without the frills of exclusivity: ideal for private morning meetings and late-night drinks.', 'Anything to say about the service?\n The first thing you’ll notice are the golden safety pins on the staff’s lapels – a nod to one of the late Alexander McQueen’s final collections inspired by the dandy days of the past. It’s this attention to detail that the team embody from start to finish, from the front desk to the bar-backs and the smiling doorman. The team is a well-oiled machine, matching the waiting-on-your-hand-and-foot standards of its countryside siblings.', 'What sort of person comes here?\n Cliveden regulars in town for a weekend of exploring. Serious shoppers with multiple Hermès bags in hand.', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?\n The nearby streets are packed with smart and shiny drinking dens, independent galleries and high-end shops. Leafy Green Park is around the corner, as is Shepherd Market and one of our favorite London restaurants, Kitty Fisher’s.', 'Anything you don’t like?\n It feels as if most of London is currently under construction so some of the views are slightly marred by cranes and scaffolding.', 'A final note: is it worth it?\n Yes, as the new kid on the block, The Mayfair Townhouse is already up there with long-standing classics, but bringing a fresh flare of fun and mischief to the postcode']","27-41 Half Moon Street, London W1J 7BG, London",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/the-mayfair-townhouse,https://www.themayfairtownhouse.com/
"Lime Tree Hotel, Belgravia",,3,"This Ebury Street townhouse conversion is a masterclass in how to maximize eclectic style in a small space. It also delivers on a hard-to-keep promise: an elegant hangout that feels like home, in a great location, at an affordable price. Owners Matt and Charlotte Goodsall opened the property in 2008, quickly turning it into the area’s loveliest little boutique hotel and the best affordable hotel in London. They reframed challenge as opportunity during the 2020 lockdown, overhauling the interiors and adding a new café. The couple enlisted Fraher & Findlay architects, whose previous projects include Wolf & Badger in Coal Drops Yard, but relied on their own taste for the decorative details, sprucing up corners with Sanderson wallpaper and Pooky lampshades. The 28 bedrooms range from minuscule to moderately sized, but this only contributes to the country-cottage cosiness. Clever design ensures that even the tiniest space is optimized, with teal velvet headboards, mountains of ikat pillows and marmalade-colored armchairs (thoughtful reading material is provided—ours was Aesop’s Fables). Single rooms come at a keener price, so solo travelers are well looked after. The Buttery kitchen is helmed by Stefano Cirillo, previously at Notting Hill spot Beach Blanket Babylon. Breakfast is made up of perfectly executed classics—avocado on sourdough with runny eggs, chocolate-spread-layered French toast topped with berries, a full English with halloumi—accompanied by the smell of freshly ground Gentlemen Baristas beans and crunchy pastries from the bakery down the road.

It’s been years since Shoreditch’s street-food stalls, concept bars and cutting-edge boutiques started taking off. Then came the smart stays, award-winning cocktail dens and Michelin-starred restaurants. Bright young creatives were quickly priced out of living here. Then, over the past 18 months, the once-buzzing streets went silent. A couple of big names closed for good and there was space for fresh players to shake up the re-emerging neighborhood scene. Mondrian, the city-slicking group dreamt up by Ian Schrager in the 1990s, was primed to launch a new London hotel after handing over the keys of its South Bank stalwart a few years ago. The company, helmed by the Reuben brothers, took over splashy members'-club-hotel The Curtain when it shuttered and brought in design studio Goddard Littlefair – also behind the 2016 facelift of Scotland’s Gleneagles—to switch things up. The loveliest of the 120 whitewashed, exposed-brick rooms have large balconies and skyline views, but this is the sort of place where you won’t spend much time in bed. Art fills the lobby—spot the double-height piece by British painter Fred Coppin—while ground-floor Christina’s serves glossy pastries by day and Espresso Martinis by night. There’s a members'-only rooftop restaurant with its own pool and co-working space where events and panels are held.

Its Brutalist building and former annex of Camden Town Hall was much maligned by locals who nicknamed it the egg box. Now, with its red-pill-shaped lift that scales the Euston Road façade, it more than squares up to the splendid Gothic Revival St Pancras station nearby. Inside, American designer Shawn Hausman, a long-time Standard collaborator, created all the spaces with a decade-switching look that is mind-boggling and fabulous. Utilitarian civic signage meets Seventies Milanese terrazzo and tiling: Transport for London’s color palette inspired the loud carpets; and the colorways, shapes and humor of Italian design movement Memphis permeate everything. Rooms range from about £199 for a single, aimed at students and early-bird Eurostar travelers, to about £729 for a terraced room with an outdoor bathtub overlooking St Pancras. Expect Memphis design meets Miami with a mix of bright colours and pastels, crazy carpets and tiles. Furniture is both vintage and bespoke and all the rooms have great views.

In late 2016, the hotel’s dignified but bland 1970s face was given a startling lift by one of the world’s most prominent architects, Richard Rogers of \nPompidou Center\n fame.

The architect John Heah has already made his mark on a number of rooms, achieving calm elegance with a witty use of geometric themes (such as variations on the meeting of rectangles and circles), fine materials, and muted colors. But what remains untouched is part of what makes The Berkeley special: the glorious rooftop swimming pool (open to the sky on nice days), the ultra-relaxing Bamford Haybarn spa, and Marcus Wareing’s fine two-Michelin-star restaurant.

Nobu Hotel London Portman Square,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",0,"Nobu Hotel Portman Square spills out onto a cool, cosmopolitan terrace reminiscent of New York (fitting, perhaps, considering Lower Manhattan was where the legendary Nobu restaurant first opened in 1994) and builds on Nobu’s Park Lane legacy while adding fresh, minimalist rooms and chill-out spaces to complete the picture. There are no frills or fancy here—it’s all smooth urban energy with design-led chairs and sleek tables where London’s glitterati fine-dine on signature dishes such as black cod miso and yellowtail sashimi, sizzling wagyu beef, Chilean sea bass and wasabi lime miso. As one of the best restaurants in London, the space (and omakase multi-course tasting menu) feels grown up, sexy even, with flashes of diamonds, stilettos and red lacquered chopsticks, while the bedrooms demonstrate Japanese minimalism in its purest form: clean lines, muted woods, restrained natural fabrics. For a near-mythical, indulgent (and mind-blowingly tasty) lunch or supper experience, followed by a calming sleep in the bedrooms, this is a hotel that’s earned its spot occupying the corner of one of Marylebone’s handsomest patches. Staying without booking a table in the restaurant is akin to visiting The Ritz and forgoing their famed London afternoon tea.","['After the rollicking success of their East \nLondon\n location, the team behind the celebrity-magnet sushi bar and hotel brand—including chef Nobu Matsuhisa and Robert De Niro—brought their signature Japanese-inspired minimalism to tony Marylebone, transforming an old business hotel into something at once familiar and brand new. On the familiar side, you’ll still find all of Matsuhisa’s classics at the restaurant, including miso black cod, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi with thinly sliced jalapeños. For something uniquely London, the hotel has also put together an afternoon tea ceremony, inspired by the East-meets-West artworks of Gavin Mitchell, with a menu that includes Canton Teas (in flavors like lychee-rose and genmaicha) and snacks like beef tataki sandos and miso caramel éclairs. Upstairs, guest rooms are slick and stylish, with leather headboards, yukata robes, heavy Japanese tea sets, and Grown Alchemist toiletries that smell good enough to eat.']","22 Portman Square, London W1H 7BG, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/nobu-hotel-london-portman-square,https://london-portman.nobuhotels.com/
Beaverbrook Town House,"Hot List, 2022.

It feels like a joyous and timely celebration of the capital—especially on the stairs where an extraordinary collection of artwork has been cherry-picked by creative director and advertising legend Frank Lowe: old posters for the Boat Race, Brooks’ Peckham Brewery and Kew Gardens. Just as bedrooms in the country mansion pay homage to former owner Lord Beaverbrook’s friends and guests, here each one is named after a London theatre, with framed programs of past productions and books on opera and Laurence Olivier. Interior designer Nicola Harding, who previously worked on the estate’s Garden House, has used a bolder, more playful palette for this spin-off, lending it a grown-up urban edge. Four-posters and fringed velvet sofas sit alongside antique desks, patterned lampshades and cushions made from vintage fabrics by Penny Worrall; bathrooms are equally colourful, with glassy tiles in rich apple green and bottle blue. On the ground floor, a Japanese apothecary cabinet at the entrance of the arsenic-hued, Art Deco-detailed bar marks a shift to the East. The best spot in the Fuji Grill restaurant, helmed by ex-Dinings SW3 chef Alex Del, is at the counter, where a sensational 20-course omakase supper is prepared, combining traditional techniques with modern European elements for dishes that might include tuna dry aged in house and hamachi sashimi with smoked aubergine.

Rooms are large and traditional but never frumpy; and in a world of shrinking bathtubs, The Savoy's remain satisfyingly deep. The Savoy Grill is excellent and The River Restaurant by Gordon Ramsay brings the best of British seafood and shellfish; and the hotel is blessed with two of the finest watering holes in London, The American Bar, granddaddy of London's cocktail bars, and its younger, sassier sibling, The Beaufort Bar.

But a century and a half on, it's looking grand, as sophisticated and elegant as it did when Napoleon III spent the night. These days the Victoriana and chinoiserie are offset by smooth, occasionally quirky contemporary elements—notably in the award-winning Artesian bar, with its timber chandeliers, imitation-snakeskin flooring and resin-topped tables. It would be difficult to name a finer hotel restaurant than Roux at the Landau, where father-and-son dream team Albert and Michel Roux Jr have been casting their culinary spells.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThis great big castle of a building is less than five minutes' walk from Oxford Circus, but far enough for the noise of crowds to have dissipated. The Langham first opened in 1865, so it’s self-assured, yet more modern than most hotels of its age. The vibe is opulent without being ostentatious—the lobby is all dramatic marble columns and a dripping chandelier; next door, the Artesian Bar has a touch of \nAlice in Wonderland\n about it, with purple sofas and work-of-art cocktails."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nShoppers, entrepreneurs, and luxury lovers. The BBC building is across the street, so you’ll find news anchors and soap stars propping up the bar.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThis is a big hotel—there are 333 rooms. One-hundred-eighty-eight of these are Superior Rooms, the smallest category, which are elegant and traditional, if a tiny bit nondescript—lots of cream with sage flourishes. Naturally, the more you pay, the fripperies increase. Ask for a room facing Cavendish Square on the seventh floor and above and you’ll have views stretching to the London Eye.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nNespresso coffee machines in all the rooms are a welcome touch. Book an Executive Room or above and you’ll have access to the Langham Club—two floors of extras, including butler and concierge service, access to meeting rooms, complimentary breakfast, light afternoon tea and evening canapés, and, best of all, complimentary Champagne cocktails all day long.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nBathrooms in the standard rooms are all creamy tiles and black marble with showers over the bathtub.', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi.

It has a more informal menu devised by Michel Roux, Jr. The Wigmore opened in 2017, and is very much its own entity, a very luxurious pub with emerald walls, parquet floors, and its own locally brewed beer. The food, also overseen by Roux, Jr., is both delicious and affordable—try the masala spiced scotch eggs. In the spa, the nearly 53-foot-long swimming pool is long enough to do laps.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nFive-star hotels don’t come more luxurious or better-located than this.']","1C Portland Pl., London W1B 1JA, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-kingdom/london/the-langham-london,http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/london/

That wouldn't be entirely fair, but there's no escaping the fact that chef Jason Atherton's ground-floor Berners Tavern is the palpitating heart of the hotel. The lobby cocktail bar, oak-paneled, reservation-only Punch Room and nightclub Basement only increase the pulse-rate. Ian Schrager's considered, gimmick-free design has given the stucco, marble and stained-glass of the historic lobby a funky edge; upstairs, rooms are James Bond-slick, with buttoned-linen George Smith sofas alongside Scandinavian wishbone chairs and Schrager's trademark floor-to-ceiling white drapes. They are also marvelously quiet, a perfect antidote to the hubbub below.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nIan Schrager is best known for Studio 54 in \nNew York\n and launching the concept of boutique hotels, so unsurprisingly, walking into this property feels like joining the party. The lobby is also the bar, with a billiards table, lofty stucco ceiling, giant chrome egg dangling from it, and open fire—there’ll be loud chatter over gin and tonics and people reclining on sofas pretending to work on their MacBooks. It's an entertaining mix of bright young things, finance swells, and hipster guests. And no wonder: The hotel, along with being one of London’s most stylish spots right now, is home to the Punch Room, one of the hottest clubs in town, located in the middle of Fitzrovia."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nThe glamorous, sociable kind. This hotel is all about moving and shaking in the impressive communal spaces.', ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nSchrager has partnered with Marriott to launch the Edition brand and, as such, the rooms don’t vary much, except for size. They're good, though: White walls and linen are warmed up by oak floors and paneling, along with faux fur throws. The smallest of the rooms feel a touch shoebox, although all have a slim desk, a lounge chair, and a Hendriks Kerstens photograph, inspired by portraits by Dutch masters."", 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nIf you like the super-soft linen you can buy it (along with the bed and most other things you can lay your hands on) from the \nonline shop\n.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThe minibars are imaginative, including iced coffee and earl grey tea lip balm instead of boring Britvic.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nMinimalist white-tiled bathrooms have rain showers—only a handful have baths. Le Labo products have a specially designed scent.', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nFree.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nIn-room food comes from Berners Tavern. It’s available round the clock and surprisingly good value—a plate of mushroom gnocchi costs $20.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nBerners Tavern is still one of the city’s hottest tickets. Directed by star chef Jason Atherton, the walls are crammed with art in glittering gilt frames—it’s super for a special occasion but not the least bit stuffy. Go in the evening (it’s too fancy for lunch) and book ahead, preferably a shell-colored booth if you can get one, and try the barbecue pork chop ($35).', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nIt isn't cheap, but you can easily spend more on less grand London establishments.""]","10 Berners St, London W1T 3NP, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/the-london-edition,https://www.editionhotels.com/london/

There's now an award-winning, state-of-the-art spa, zeitgeisty restaurants by Daniel Boulud and Heston Blumenthal, and perpetually packed bars (not one, not two, but three, and all terrific in their very different ways). In June 2018, straight off the back of the biggest refurbishment in this Hyde Park hotel’s history, a major roof fire kept the hotel closed for another 10 months. Reopening in April 2019, the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park retains elements of its gentler, more cosily traditional past, but with interiors that have had a modern makeover, and are significantly lighter and brighter. Meanwhile, the clippity-clop that rises faintly from the Hyde Park side as horses from the Household Cavalry make their way past the hotel never gets old.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\nPerched on the edge of \nHyde Park\n, the Mandarin Oriental, a turreted, red-brick Edwardian confection, is the closest you’ll get to staying in an actual palace."", ""What's the backstory?\nThe hotel closed in 2016 to undergo a major spruce-up, but a huge roof fire in 2018 set everything back. It finally reopened in April 2019 after a rumored $123 million makeover. Today, the lobby has lots of glass to reflect the light and serene photographs by Mary McCartney; feather motifs and greenery prevail throughout. The history of the building—and roll call of its famous past and present guests—could fill a book. There’s a dedicated royal entrance originally built for Queen Victoria; Winston Churchill used to check in regularly; and Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret took dance lessons here."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nRooms are as grand as they were pre-renovation, but they feel less serious. The heavily patterned fabrics have been replaced by wooden floors, soft, earthy tones, and Art Deco flourishes. Bathrooms are slathered with white marble, and the luxury of the heated toilet seats is not to be underestimated. Views of Hyde Park cost extra, of course.', ""Is there a charge for Wi-Fi, and how is the quality?\nIt's free and fast."", 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe restaurant and bar are destinations in their own right. The former is Heston Blumenthal’s only London offering, and his signature creamy, mandarin-shaped liver parfait is still one of the city’s most lusted-after dishes. The French chef Daniel Boulud is the brains behind the more informal Bar Boulud, which does perfect bistro classics like onion soup and steak frites.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\nThere’s a mix, from uncompromising business travelers to West London pleasure-seekers to celebrities like Liam Neeson.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\nThe Mandarin Oriental crowns the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"With their first foray into London, Rosewood has created not just a magnificent new hotel but a whole new neighborhood: 'Midtown', previously known, without any of that implied New York spunk, as plain old Holborn. Yet the location is extraordinary, starting with the most unexpected of courtyards, like a mini Somerset House, from which a kind of country-house vibe emanates – a country house, however, with a tremendous sense of wit and panache. The style of the interiors is difficult to characterize, by turns demure and decadent, muted and glossy, traditional and contemporary. The overall effect is dazzling. The perpetually jammed Scarfe's Bar and the elegantly elongated Mirror Room are at either end of an exquisitely lit bronze corridor that insulates the lobby from the outside world. The Holborn Dining Room, run by Calum Franklin, adds a lively brasserie buzz. Sitting outside in the courtyard terrace in summer with a glass of something chilled is a joy.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nCentral London hotels are often squirreled away, \nAlice in Wonderland\n-style, behind nondescript front doors. Not the Rosewood. The arrival here, on one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares, elicits the same gasps as would winding up at a country manor house. The building used to be the unexciting-sounding headquarters of Pearl Assurance, but its style is more \nDownton Abbey\n than insurance agency—an archway leads underneath the columns of an ornate façade before opening out into a grand Edwardian courtyard.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nThe vibe here is unrestrained luxury for traditional taste buds—communal spaces are all marble and mahogany with a neutral color palette that won’t scare the horses. And the crowd is to match—a mature, tasteful set with plenty of cash to spare. You’re just near the Inns of Court, so you might find judges sipping gin by the fire in the snug Scarfes bar, and foodies tripping through for the city’s best pies (more on those later).', ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nEven the smallest rooms are spacious by London standards, and all have room for a king bed and a little table and chairs. Décor is elegantly monochrome with humbug-striped carpeting and interesting touches such as Shakespeare quotes engraved in the glass-topped tables. The Manor House Wing is the only suite in the world with its own post code, and it's larger than the average house, with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and its own private elevator."", 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds are wrapped in baby-soft Rivolta Carmignani Italian linen.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies.

Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThere are four restaurants but the one meal you really shouldn’t miss is that quintessentially British dish, a pie, consumed on a plump red banquette seat in the Holborn Dining Room. Chef Calum Franklin’s work-of-art pastries are so good that the hotel has opened the Pie Room, making perfect, glossy sausage rolls and pork pies to take away. On another note, the spa gets busy so be sure to book ahead if you fancy a treatment.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nAn 11 p.m. pre-bed pie is worth the trip in itself.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThe price tag is painful but this crowd-pleaser will impress your mother-in-law, your boss, and even pop stars like Bieber (who has stayed here).']","252 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EN, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/rosewood-london,https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/london
Bulgari Hotel London,,3,"Just when you thought the vita in this part of town couldn't get any more dolce, along came this gem from the great Roman jewelery house. It's all very hard-edged and stealthily spoiling, but softened and enlivened with thoughtful design touches such as bedside lamps inspired by Bulgari's classic silver candlesticks. The clever use of subterranean space is one of The Bulgari's distinguishing features – there's a serious screening room, the swimming pool is positively radiant with golden mosaic tiles, and the spa is among the biggest and best in the city.","['Why book?\n\xa0Ten years after its opening, the Bulgari Hotel London still feels like one of the city’s best kept secrets. The central Knightsbridge location is one of its biggest draws, thanks to its proximity to \nHyde Park\n, the \nVictoria and Albert Museum\n, and Harrod’s, to name but a few nearby attractions. The hotel blends history with modernity, mixing Bulgari’s timeless glamor with a contemporary flair. The rooms are surprisingly spacious, particularly by \nLondon\n’s standards, and there many treasures within, like a glimmering spa recalling a Roman bath, a coveted cigar lounge, and a private, state-of-the-art cinema.\xa0\\', 'Set the scene\n From the street, it’s easy to mistake the hotel for a residential building. There are no flags out front and the exterior feels quite discrete, despite its location in the heart of Knightsbridge. Inside, the residential spirit continues in The Bulgari Lounge, a recently revamped living room space that invites guests and locals to stop for a quick lunch, coffee, or a meeting with colleagues. Thanks to its popular gym, led by Workshop’s Lee Mullins, the hotel is also a hot-spot with locals in the city. Its newly-renovated restaurant, Sette, and bar, Nolita Social, are local hangouts, as is the Cigar Shop and Sampling Lounge, boasting the vintage collection of internationally renowned and multi-awarded cigar merchant, Edward Sahakian. The pocket-sized room is filled with cedar wood cabinets baring Sahakian’s private collection of vintage and pre-embargo cigars. The hotel attracts a diverse mix of backgrounds, including actors, musicians, sports personalities and entrepreneurs, all of whom are drawn to the timeless Italian design, the expansive interiors, and the attentive yet relaxed service.', 'The backstory\n The Bulgari Hotel opened in London ten years ago this spring, just before the 2012 Summer Olympics. It was the third property to open under the Bulgari Hotels & Resorts collection, and was built from the ground up. Because of this, the hotel feels more like a Knightsbridge residence than a typical luxury hotel. Today, the property is privately owned, and the top three floors boast sprawling penthouse residences.\nThe rooms\n Each of the 85 rooms, of which 23 are suites, are notably generous, particularly in a city like London where space is at a premium. My Knightsbridge Suite, No. 408, was a whopping 925 square feet and had a beautiful sitting room wrapped in glass and laid with contemporary Italian furniture and Bulgari coffee table books. The bedroom opened to a large and striking bathroom covered in black Marquina marble. The seven Bulgari Suites are a treat in every sense with large living rooms and 10-person dining tables, modern kitchens, and beautiful master bedrooms, with his-and-her walk in closets, striking onyx showers, and terraces in some. All of the rooms boast neutral colors thanks to sumptuous marble and polished Sapele Mahogany, with gem-colored rugs that recall the stones in Bulgari’s jewelry. I loved the detail reflected in the design, like the fine Damask fabrics, which featured a floral pattern inspired by the silver chatelaine motif from a 19\nth\n century Bulgari brooch. I also loved the leather-wrapped travel-trunks-turned-mini-bars that were made exclusively for the brand.', 'Food and drink\n Located just off the lobby, The Bulgari Lounge is a popular place to stop in for a quick lunch of Italian classics. To commemorate the hotel’s 10\nth\n anniversary, The Lounge is introducing an Italian Afternoon Tea at the end of the month, led by the Italian pastry chef and chocolatier Gianluca Fusta, who is doing a one-year residency at the property. They’ve also introduced a Dolci experience showcasing Fusta’s contemporary artisanal pastries. The hotel’s primary restaurant, Sette, is a modern street-level space that beckons with handsome leather furnishings and a menu of Italian classics, along with homemade pastas and breads. The relaxed yet polished venue is the latest from New York’s Scarpetta restaurant group and is a popular gathering place for locals from Knightsbridge and neighboring Kensington. Aperitivo is served every evening at Sette’s bar with cocktails and cicchetti bites, and there’s a private dining room for up to 18 guests tucked into the back of the restaurant. Downstairs from Sette, Nolita Social, named after New York’s “North of Little Italy” neighborhood, brings the energy of New York’s nightlife to London with live music and DJs on Friday and Saturday nights. Light bites such as burrata and puttanesca bruschetta or cacio e pepe arancini are served alongside New York-inspired cocktails with names like “The Highline” and “The MET.”', 'The spa\n As with all of their properties, The Bulgari Spa is a hallmark of this hotel, with a dramatic 80-foot colonnaded swimming pool, which is the longest luxury hotel swimming pool in all of London. Set over two floors, materials such as onyx, Vicenza stone, and glass mosaics express the Bulgari aesthetic of timeless glamour and contemporary Italian design. During my visit, I passed saunas, ice showers, and steam rooms on route to the dim-lit relaxation lounge. With its dramatic vertical fireplace, I felt a world away from the hustle and bustle of London. Thanks to its coveted membership program, The Bulgari Spa is a landmark for locals and a center of wellbeing in the city. The Spa recently partnered with award-winning beauty brand Augustinus Bader and is introducing new treatments, like the Augustinus Bader Exclusive Bulgari Facial.', 'The neighborhood/area\n The prestigious Knightsbridge neighborhood is home to the city’s most exclusive addresses, not to mention beloved shopping destinations and iconic cultural institutions. Guests at The Bulgari Hotel London enjoy all that this central location has to offer. Mega department stores like Harvey Nichols and Harrod’s are mere steps away, as is Hyde Park and landmarks such as The Royal Albert Hall and The Victoria and Albert Museum. The Knightsbridge Barracks is directly across the street, and much to my delight, my room offered a unique vantage of the groomed horses stabled within.', 'The service\n The staff here has an English elegance and panache, though there’s a palpable friendliness and Mediterranean warmth. I came down with the flu shortly after checking in but their kind and accommodating team made me feel at home. The concierge arranged a private doctor’s visit and sent up a steady supply of tea, toast, and medicine from the local pharmacy. I loved the personalized calling cards that were printed on arrival with my name and the hotel address, and the pillow menu was another nice touch, with selections ranging from lavender aromatherapy to rosemary, mint, and flax seed. The concierge can organize all sorts of unique experiences, from private river cruises to helicopter rides and tailor-made excursions, such as a private viewing of the Crown Jewels or a culinary adventure exploring the history of London’s food scene, from jellied eels and Sweeney Todd pies in the East End to the Queen’s favorite cheese purveyor in Mayfair.\xa0Another popular experience is the private Rock and Roll tour exploring the side streets and alleyways, recording studios and watering holes of the world’s greatest performers through the decades.', 'For families\n The hotel’s relaxed ambiance and spacious rooms make it a great option for families traveling through the British capital. The hotel also has a citywide treasure hunt worth noting. Families partake in a four-hour quest across the city to institutions like Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden before ending either at lunch or at Hamleys, London’s largest toy store. Furthermore, the London location is home to one of Bulgari’s Little Gems Kids Clubs to ensure young guests have a memorable stay.', 'Eco effort\n London’s Bulgari Hotel was built and developed according to best practices in BREEAM certified design. The hotel was the first of its kind in the UK to use Geothermal Ground Source Heat Pumps to generate geothermal energy. The building also has a green roof by the London Biodiversity Action plan with support boxes for birds and bats, along with energy-conserving intelligent lighting and rain water collection. There are electric car charging points and bikes are available to guests for exploring Hyde Park and the city beyond. The hotel is also working on reducing plastic as much as possible. Today, all of their slippers are made in fabric and cork, cocktail straws are made from sugar cane, and laundry bags are made in compostable fabric.', 'Accessibility\n The hotel is ADA accessible.', 'Anything left to mention?\n During my visit, I got a sneak peek of The Bulgari Private Cinema, a 47-seat theatre that is dedicated to the late Lord Richard Attenborough. The private rental space, which pays homage to Bulgari’s historic connection to the silver screen, is popular for film premiers, business presentations, and for private screenings. The hotel has a curated library of 300 new and classic titles available to choose from. I also highly recommend a private training session with Lee Mullins, Founder of WORKSHOP. Mullins has created the premier destination for health and fitness in London at his gymnasium, where clients begin with a FRAMEWORK assessment that leads to a goal-oriented, personalized guidebook for working out and achieving optimal health.', 'Finally, in 100 words or less, what makes this hotel worthy of Hot List?\n There are few options in the British capital that are as stylish as they are spacious. The Bulgari Hotel is one of those places. The property’s roomy and residential feel, contemporary Italian design, leading wellness program, buzzing food and beverage offering, and unbeatable Knightsbridge location make it a classic ten years after opening its doors.']","171 Knightsbridge, London SW7 1DW, United Kingdom, London SW7 1DW, United Kingdom",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/london/bulgari-hotel-london,https://www.bulgarihotels.com/en_US/london

Gran Hotel Inglés,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",2,"Although you can hardly tell today, Gran Hotel Inglés is the oldest hotel in the city; when it opened, in fact, a local newspaper praised the mere existence of “a lift, bathroom on each floor, lighting, steam heating and all of the advances that make life more comfortable.” Over the years, Gran Hotel has drawn writers, politicians, and even esteemed bullfighters. Renovated, thoroughly modern, and down to 48 rooms from its original 72, today the property is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\nLike any brilliant hotel these days, the first thing you see is a big, inviting lobby bar with plenty of leather-covered couches, armchairs, and bar stools to sit in. The bar itself is an island, with a nifty hanging liquor shelf. The Rockwell Group Madrid designed it to be glamorous in a way that works for the hotel's history and location—in other words, not unwarranted or needlessly flashy. Also, the space is big; and in a city crammed with small bodegas and wine bars, where room to move about comes at a premium, it feels like a place you'd want to come and hang out in for a while."", ""How was check in?\nVery, very easy. Though the reception desk isn't the first thing you notice (it's discreet, and off to the right, which I like), you certainly don't get lost looking for it, either. Staff were warm and professional, and very much cared about informing me about the hotel and how it complements the surrounding neighborhood. Oh, and they also provided typed-up, personalized notes on things to do and see in the 'hood, which was so valuable; Gran Inglés is in Madrid's central literary quarter, which has largely gone under the radar, but has such historical wealth—palaces, caña bars frequented by Hemingway, all a stone's throw from your room. (But I wouldn't have known it!)"", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nHere's the thing: Some rooms face the street, and some don't. Those with street views are utterly charming—think the Spanish take on the rooftop views you've seen from Parisian or Roman balconies a million times (chimneys, window boxes, and terraces stacked three or four stories high). That said, this area of Madrid is getting very popular at night, and Madrileños stay out later than even New Yorkers—so you might hear some noise outside your window until as late (or early) as 5 a.m."", ""Rooms are tastefully done—modern, but restrained—maybe in nod to the hotel's history (it first opened in 1886). I loved the personalized notes on the neighborhood. And hotel bath lovers, take note: The deep, sunken, free-standing tubs have tarnished bronze stands for soaps and scrubs, and are the kind you'll stay in until even your shins are wrinkled."", ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe F+B is solid. The bar does \nexcellent drinks\n—I had them mix me up a tasty gin concoction based on flavors I told them I did (and did \nnot\n) like, and they nailed it. In-room dining is fine, but not massively worth it—mostly burgers and pizza that won't taste nearly as good as the downstairs restaurant, Lobo8, which does creative spins on classic Spanish dishes (think pink tomato salads with avocado ice cream, pear gazpacho, and Iberian pork cheeks)."", 'About the staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nNelson, who showed me to my room! You could tell how proud he was of the hotel, and genuinely cared that I enjoy it the best I could. That said, every single member of the staff impressed me; always with a smile, always greeting me by my name, and very helpful with anything I may have needed, be it an umbrella, an Uber, or a cocktail rec.', ""What type of travelers will you find here?\nGran Hotel Inglés is for the type of well-styled, but not flashy, urbanite—someone who posts about her far-flung, glamorous travels on Instagram, but has no desire to be a career-influencer. This is the crowd you'd see at Rome's \nHotel Vilòn\n, or Paris's \nHôtel Providence\n. Mature, with excellent taste."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\nThe gym is fine, if not the most comprehensive—but the spa does a mean jet lag massage.', ""Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\nOne million percent worth it, especially since it attracts locals as much as visitors (for the bar, of course)—but because it's in one of the most convenient neighborhoods in town. The balance of historical and modern is nicely captured, which isn't always a given with European properties.""]","Calle de Echegaray, 8, Madrid 28014, Spain",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/gran-hotel-ingles,https://www.granhotelingles.com/

"Santo Mauro, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Madrid","Gold List, 2023.",2,"Recently, the upper end of Madrid’s hotel scene has erupted in a welter of blue-chip international brands—but three decades before the current boom, Santo Mauro was already offering its discreet brand of noble luxe. Built between 1860 and 1902 as the private palacio of the Dukes of Santo Mauro, the 49-room hotel, now owned by Antonio Catalán, occupies an affluent corner of the Chamberí neighborhood where the ebullience of downtown Madrid gives way to a patrician quietude. The high-ceilinged public rooms seem to compete with one another in fin de siècle grandeur, but thanks to design doyen Lorenzo Castillo, who recently undertook a major refresh of the hotel’s interiors, what might once have been suffocatingly opulent now has a certain lightness and chic. Expansive, expensive fabrics adorn the walls and windows; restored parquet floors creak authentically as you pad across them; ceiling moldings are subtly under-lit. The 93-member staff, smiling and as impeccably turned out as the surroundings, make you believe you’re a friend of the duke, simply hanging out for a night or two in your regular Madrid bolt-hole. Meanwhile in the French-style formal garden, deliciously re-imagined by landscaper Fernando Valero as a maze of box hedges and trickling fountains, the gravel crunches underfoot. From beyond a line of towering horse chestnut trees and a high fence hung with ivy comes the murmur of what may just be, right now, Spain’s most exciting city. Hard though it is to tear yourself away from this well-upholstered bubble of gorgeousness, it must be done.","['Why book?\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThe Santo Mauro is that precious thing—a hotel whose classic status lies beyond the tawdry grasp of modern life.\xa0 A recent refurb has only enhanced its perennial charm. Palatially posh it may be—but as in all the best such places, the sumptuousness is nicely leavened with discretion and friendliness.', 'Set the scene\nThe\xa0\npalacio\n was designed by architect Juan Bautista Lázaro in the French style fashionable in late 19th-century Spain, with a nod to\xa0\nmadrileño\n\xa0tradition in the fish-scale gray slate roofs. A trio of buildings, including two grand houses and a former stables, sits among 10,000 square feet of pleasure-garden with pavilions and\xa0\nterrazas\n\xa0for high-summer lounging. Hung with engravings and stuffed with antique furniture, the interior is pitched somewhere between English country house and aristocratic Parisian mansion.', 'The backstory\nOpen as a hotel since 1991, the Santo Mauro was absorbed into the Marriott empire in 2011 and recently joined that company’s Luxury Collection marque. (Interestingly, however, the M-word barely figures here.) \xa0 Though it’s long been a favorite of dignitaries and potentates—not to mention Real Madrid footballers—the redesign has removed some of the old exclusiveness and hauteur, rendering it not only cozier but also (and this might sound surprising) more fun.', 'Food and drink\nResidents of Madrid’s swish Barrio de Salamanca have begun dropping in for lunch at Rafa Peña’s in-house restaurant, an outpost of his Gresca in Barcelona. (Think Palamós prawn croquetas, caviar profiteroles, hare\xa0\na la royale\n.) In the Gin Bar, whose blue leather armchairs might be channeling some London gentlemen’s club, mixologist Filippo serves signature Santo Mauro cocktails (try a Tea Time) with a ‘\nsalute\n’ and a dish of fried almonds. The impressive breakfast, served with great ceremony at linen-clad tables, is worth forgoing diets and routines for.', 'The neighborhood\nPoised between fashionable Almagro and classy Salamanca districts, the hotel’s neighbors are embassies, private health clinics, and high-ceilinged apartment blocks with wrought-iron balconies.\xa0 Strolling the tree-lined streets of Monte Esquinza or Zurbano, you could easily imagine yourself in some upscale\xa0\nquartier\n of Paris or Brussels.', 'For families\nFrankly it’s hard to imagine what small children might find to enjoy in this hotel. And with all those fine carpets and furnishings, those Grecian urns poised on plinths, you can’t help thinking the feeling might be mutual.', ""Anything left to mention?\n\xa0\nIf five-star frippery doesn’t float your boat, the Santo Mauro may be\xa0\nde trop\n. This is the kind of place where you find little cards, tucked away in the corners of your room, intimating that the fluffy white bathrobe provides “Exceptional Comfort” or that an “Ice Service” offering fresh ice cubes and a bucket is a phone call away.

Andy Warhol and other prints line the wall.

Even better, that forward-looking design made space for both work desks and small sitting areas including some rooms with outdoor terraces.

Eliot, the first of the great foreign literary talents to settle in the neighborhood to study philosophy at the Sorbonne, took up residence in one of the rooms for a time. In 1920, James Joyce followed suit with his wife and two children to finish the manuscript for Ulysses, published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare and Company, the original bookstore she opened in 1921 on the other side of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. It’s around this time that all three buildings formally turned into three individual “traveler” hotels and remained separate until a company rehabilitated and joined them together, opening the modest Hôtel Saint in 2016.

Following nine years of construction, the post office has reopened (though it now closes at midnight), and the hotel pays homage to its shared residence and neighbor courtesy of thoughtful design touches, such as 800 pieces of mail art hung throughout. The collection was purchased from one collector whose only request upon selling it was that it be displayed. Signed, sealed, and delivered, indeed."", 'The rooms\n The property’s color palette of woodsy browns and golden yellows is maintained throughout each room—whether it’s the corner Suite 382 facing the Eiffel Tower, 347 with a leveled view of the Saint-Eustache cathedral, or one of the 40 inner courtyard rooms that have outdoor terraces. All rooms are on the third floor (though, it’s really six levels up) and reaching them via the dark corridors is easy, thanks to signs and directions denoting the street they’re facing, as the enormous building lines four of them: Rue de Louvre, Rue Etienne Marcel, Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, and Cour Gutenberg. The subtle, yet smart mail theme continues in the rooms with cheeky custom-made carpets that, in French, read: “Dear, I tried to pay my taxes with a smile, but they preferred a check.” Not all of the mosaic-tiled bathrooms come with bathtubs, but most rooms have onyx desks and tables, tan leather chairs, and brass lamps that give off a Bond-meets-Balmain vibe. Come evening, the room still felt a bit too seductive for applying makeup or getting dressed, despite digitally operated lighting functionality—with daylight, night light, and black out options (the latter being for when you want to close the electric shades). But, I suppose, with such sumptuous linens and perfectly plump king-size pillows, who needs to get dressed anyway?', 'Food and drink\n The hotel has two restaurants. First is the stately, art deco-inspired Kitchen by Stéphanie Le Quellec, where uncomplicated but well-executed classic French dishes are is served all day long in a moody space with 26-foot ceilings and high-back swivel chairs at the bar, or the sunny outdoor terrace that seats 70. Second is La Plûme, a Franco-Japanese offering that’s definitely the property’s pride and joy—not only because its menu is also available as room service, but also because of its super sexy, dimly lit dining room. (It’s so dark at night, in fact, the table of four older men in suits, sans ties, who arrived as we were finishing dessert had to use their cell phone flashlights to see the menu.) Guests either enter from inside the hotel, on the same floor of the rooms themselves; or from rue Etienne Marcel, walking down a tunnel-like hallway and taking a lift to the third floor. Either way, the crowd arrives late, around 9 p.m. Cocktails get a peacock plûme garnish, while the music is poppy at dinner (think Michael Jackson and Britney Spears) and jazzy at breakfast.', 'In the evening, dishes came out at a pleasant pace, and silverware was changed between courses. We could’ve used some more water after our two half-bottles of flat and bubbly water ran out, but I suppose the unfinished sake led them to believe we had something to quaff our \nsoif\n. While the crispy fried avocado pieces have a kick—especially once you dip them in the chili sauce—there’s no need to wave anyone down for a cucumber to calm the taste buds or tissues to dot any tearing eyes. The prices skew high—roasted duck with sweet potato pickles is €34 and the lobster hotpot is €46—but each dish is worth it. Even the salad with asparagus and avocado, doused in wasabi dressing, is more than just a bowl of mache greens. Breakfast, while decidedly quieter, is sunny thanks to the east-facing windows directly across from the gothic Saint-Eustache cathedral; with typical menu options executed perfectly, whether it’s a poached egg on avocado toast or a buttery mushroom and cheese omelet.', 'The spa\n The first-floor wellness center is very DIY. There’s no official check-in desk, so upon exiting the elevator it’s a little unclear where to wait. After peeking around the hallways, down which there’s a fairly large sauna and a well-stocked fitness room (treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, boxing bag, ballet bar, yoga mats, weights, etc.), you’ll have no choice but to sit on the tan leather, boudoir-like couch where only a sheer curtain hangs between you in your robe and the public addressing letters at the post office below. Pay them no mind and help yourself to a hot tea or cucumber water before being brought into one of two treatment rooms, where skin and body treatments include the likes of a “sweet” or “savory” scrub (using either sugar or salt) or the utterly relaxing “Madame Rêve Modeling” massage.', 'The neighborhood/area\n This is as central Paris as you can get.

From the start, The Ritz Paris has been a Grand Siècle-style hotel with a modern soul and, much as in 1898, change is afoot. It’s said that when he was too ill to dine out, Marcel Proust had chicken and potatoes sent over from The Ritz Paris—now those hallowed kitchens are home to their first female head chef, Eugénie Béziat. Chef Béziat was born in Gabon to French parents and spent her childhood in Africa, so the flagship restaurant, Espadon, features dishes such as chicken yassa, a Senegalese speciality, and barbecued lobster with cassava semolina. Meanwhile, down a warmly lit hall is Bar Hemingway, named for the American novelist who scrimped for a cocktail a week at The Ritz. Last spring, longtime head bartender Colin Field (inventor of the Clean Dirty Martini, served with an ice cube of olive juice) stepped aside, and his protégé Anne-Sophie Prestail, has come in from the wings. —Jo Rodgers","[""So, what's the story behind this place?\nIn 1898, Swiss hotelier César Ritz partnered with French chef Auguste Escoffier to open what soon became known as one of the most luxurious hotels in the world, thanks to such then-innovative touches as private bathrooms, telephones, and electricity in each room. Over the decades, the Ritz became a favorite of everyone from kings and queens to Marcel Proust and Coco Chanel; the latter, who lived here for 34 years, has a suite named for her, while fellow regular Ernest Hemingway’s name adorns both a suite and (what else?) a bar. But even an icon needs a re-fresh, so in 2012, the hotel closed for the first time in its history, re-emerging four years later with updated technologies, new facilities, and a look that’s brighter and lighter, but still gilded to the core. The majestic grand staircase still winds its way up from the lobby, chandeliers and tufted chairs abound, and liveried staffers stand at attention."", 'Who are the other guests?\nThe crowd is all deep-pockets and haute couture, including fashion, tech, and media elites, press-shy billionaires, and ladies of leisure.', 'Tell us about the digs.\nThe 142 rooms and suites are generous and elegant, with a color scheme of creams and pale pinks or blues accented by rich brocades, Louis XV furnishings, pastoral oil paintings, chandeliers, and signature flourishes like key-shaped light switches and silk tulip lampshades. The design of each of the Prestige Suites aims to reflect their respective namesakes, so you’ll find antique books lining the Marcel Proust space, and a collection of worldly souvenirs in the F. Scott Fitzgerald. All rooms have marble fireplaces, while higher floor rooms and most suites have balconies or terraces.', 'Food and drink', 'The first thing to know is that the chef, Eugénie Béziat, is the first woman to take the culinary reigns. Her talent speaks for itself but flew somewhat under Parisian radars. The 40 year-old chef grew up in Gabon, the Congo, and the Ivory Coast until she was eighteen, finding her way into cooking only at age 23, after a life-changing meal chez Hélène Darroze. Before she got the call from the Ritz, she had earned a Michelin star at La Flibuste on the French Riviera where she developed her own style. That extends to this upgraded culinary throne where she, thankfully, dispenses with the trend of obsequious homages to the heritage of the place and the legends that once ran the show. On the plate, her origins, memories, and deep flavor reservoir are unmistakable sources of inspiration but never lead into ""fusion"" territory. It is dynamic right from the first dish: fresh herbs in a yuzu gel with an herbaceous, tangy kick and continues apace with a braised tomato cake with rosemary, accompanied by a grapefruit and gentian granita. A plump grilled oyster is served with a sauce made from Para watercress, a Madagascan plant that is grown in the Paris region (plenty of other ingredients come from the Ritz\'s own vegetable gardens) served with an oyster tartare. And what may very well become her signature dish is the one that is most visually striking: an onion matured and cooked in clay, which was presented and opened tableside, comes with an heirloom Houdan chicken in a citrus jus and a tartlet garnished with yassa-style minced chicken thigh meat. And a grilled lobster tail was served in a bath of bissap which she says reminds her of an African beach barbecue. Both are clever nods to her formative years in West Africa. It hardly takes any additional courses to grasp the chef\'s bold vision and technical prowess. It is among the most exciting and unexpected fine dining experiences to play out in Paris. Dessert is overseen by the Ritz\'s supremely talented pastry chef François Perret, en place since 2016. He deftly blends his signature style with Béziat\'s risk-taking ambitions for desserts like a revisited crunchy chocolate soufflé with kororima seeds and sea salt, and a honeycombed croustillant, topped with two types of honey, almond and orange. \n—\nLindsey Tramuta', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep.

On a clear day you can see practically the entire city. If your faith in \nParis\n is flagging—which does happen but seldom lasts—a visit to the rooftop of Hôtel Dame des Arts will restore it. When this reviewer described the stupendous panorama to a Paris-born-and-bred friend, she sighed and said simply: “\nOui\n. I sometimes think about leaving Paris but the thing that prevents me is the rooftops.”', 'Set the scene', 'The Quartier Latin is, of course, a famously artsy part of town and one with strong cinematic associations. It’s no coincidence that the main typeface on the hotel’s printed materials is called Jean-Luc Godard. But you needn’t have stumbled out of a screening room at the nearby Le Champo rubbing your eyes with one hand and clutching an issue of\xa0\nCahiers du Cinéma\n in the other to appreciate what designer Raphael Navot has done here. It’s all about the interplay between curved and straight lines, hard and soft textures, glossy and matte surfaces. It’s true that the look is approximately mid-century, which fits with the Nouvelle Vague idea, but there’s no sense of pastiche about it. It’s its own thing. You’ll inhale it at a glance the moment you step inside, along with a whiff of the house perfume—nothing cloying or over-the-top, faintly nostalgic yet with an unmistakable contemporary zing and altogether rather lovely.', 'The backstory', 'Interesting for several reasons. The building was built in 1959—yesterday by Parisian standards. (The street behind the hotel has been there since 1179.) Initially it was a drama school, subsequently a Holiday Inn. “Oh, I see-e-e-e,” you might be thinking. But in fact it’s a remarkable building in every sense of the word. The main entrance, in particular, is fantastic—a long opaque sliding door with a metal lattice that takes its architectural cue from the traditional Japanese\xa0\nshoji\n but also brings to mind the dynamic modern geometries of Mondrian.', 'The rooms', 'Once again the views are a huge plus. Roughly speaking, the higher you are, the better the views get—or rather the bigger they get. Ask for a room on the sixth, seventh, or eighth floor, on the Rue Suger side, with a terrace. But this is Paris and there’s charm in all directions,\xa0\nà tous les étages\n. Style-wise, the 109 rooms are similarly got-up in a way that is at once spartan and spoiling, chic and subdued. (This applies even in the littlest rooms, which are indeed little.) There are deft touches everywhere—the bedside tables with tops as rich and glossy as a crème caramel; the autumnal tones of the curtains; the contoured eau-de-nil tiles in the bathrooms; the ongoing juxtaposition of straight and curved lines that you find throughout the hotel. All very coherent and discreetly sensuous.', 'Food and drink', 'Mexican. Really. Though not strictly Mexican-Mexican—actually a beguiling Franco-Mexican fusion with pan-Asian influences. All of which geographical, cultural, and culinary variety converges, miraculously, in the person of the chef himself, Othoniel Alvarez Castañeda, who was born and raised in Mexico, trained in France, and perfected his sashimi at the Buddha Bar. Hence on the menu at Dame des Arts you may find Breton oysters with yuzu and guajillo chili oil, beef tartare with trout eggs and chili oil, and a particularly wonderful tostada of red tuna with fried leeks and chipotle mayonnaise. The fusion principle has been applied in a thoroughgoing fashion, so that vegetarian dishes and non-alcoholic drinks are as thoughtfully contrived as their meaty and boozy counterparts. The house take on a Virgin Mary is exemplary, its lusciously thick tomato-juice base enlivened by pickled mustard seeds, kaffir-lime leaves, and a fiery sauce comprising four different Mexican chilis (one fresh, three dried, rehydrated, and toasted for a hint of smokiness), elderflower vinegar (from Normandy) and a dash of Tabasco. Lurking behind all of this deliciousness is consultant Matthieu Alfandari, formerly director of operations at the Experimental Group, which has done so much to shake up the Paris bar, restaurant, and hotel scene in recent years.', 'The spa', 'Downstairs there’s a sauna and, next to it, a single treatment room, with massages outsourced to a local firm. Appointments are available on request with two hours’ notice. Adjacent to the treatment room is an incredibly cool fitness space. With its hypnotic wave-like wooden ceiling, trick mirrors, and matchy-matchy wooden equipment (including boxing gloves in precisely the right shade of brown), it warrants a visit even if your idea of exercise is to smoke heavily on your terrace while gazing moodily at the Paris skyline.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The Quartier Latin is one of the most photogenic corners of one of the most photographed cities on earth, instantly recognizable and familiar even to those who’ve never set foot on its narrow streets or broad boulevards. The magic is potent whether it’s your first visit or your fiftieth. Familiarity breeds not contempt but love. Hôtel Dame des Arts is very much in the thick of it, just minutes away from all manner of marvels both large and small. The cathedral of Notre-Dame—the clue is there in the hotel’s name—is foremost and largest among them. For the small and less familiar variety, try the Musée Delacroix, with its astonishing courtyard garden.', 'The service', 'Delivered with charm by a young, multilingual team, brimming with enthusiasm, high on life, low on old-fashioned Parisian contempt.', 'For families', 'There are 12 rooms that can be connected. No roll-out beds, however, or kids’ menus or fluffy toys upon arrival. Not an obvious choice for families, overall.', 'Eco effort', 'Pas mal\n. Almost no single-use plastic and plenty of refillable containers including large-volume eco-totes for many of the spirits in the bar. On-site carton-compacting and organic-waste management. All “Clef Verte” suppliers, many of them local—none more so than the Boulangerie Liberté, which supplies the bread and pastries from its premises around the corner on Rue Saint-André des Arts.', 'Accessibility for those with mobility impairments', 'There are four accessible rooms with handrails, emergency buttons, walk-in showers, and extra space for wheelchair access. The ground-floor restaurant and courtyard, rooftop bar, basement fitness center, and massage rooms are all wheelchair-accessible, too.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'There was an intriguing “watch this space” aspect to the way things were shaping up at the hotel at the time of its opening.

Now part of Orso, a new collection of hotels run by hospitality-industry veterans Louis and Anouk Solanet, the sultry theatrics of the era make a welcome comeback. The couple teamed up with Charlotte de Tonnac and Hugo Sauzay, the sought-after designers behind Festen Architecture, to revive the building’s Art Deco legacy with modern touches.

The common plan is to start the evening with cocktails in the lounge adjacent the restaurant, dine at the brasserie or have a light bite at Citrons et Huitres, the hotel’s seafood bar next door, and then kick nightlife into high gear by heading one floor underground to the Mikado, a 1920s-era nightclub that the hoteliers have revived as a speakeasy reminiscent of old opium bars with plenty of room to dance (the DJ or live musician sets the vibe) until 2 a.m.Thursday through Saturday.

This time, scouring the antique markets and auctions was even more complex: each suite is devoted to a historic figure within Proust’s illustrious circle of friends—viperous high society gossip, literary salon royalty, actresses, writers, and painters.

He tapped the right talents to bring his interpretation of Parisian elegance and hospitality to life: Franck Durand, the artistic director behind Holiday Magazine and campaigns for Zara Home, Tory Burch, among others; and Charlotte de Tonnac and Hugo Sauzay, the designers behind Festen Architecture known for skillfully updating historic spaces and designing hotels that feel more like private residences (such as\xa0\nLes Roches Rouges\n and Le Pigalle). The main sitting area, between the Coquille d’Or bar and the reception area, feels at once Art Deco and Arts & Crafts with its blend of old and modern– carpets with foliage motifs, a mix of travertine and oak, medieval tapestries and vintage Louis XIII-style armchairs. The bar is the most subdued space, evoking Château Marmont with its black lacquered walls, thick carpet, and plush banquettes. It all makes for an atmosphere that’s firmly anchored in an idea of contemporary Parisian style.', 'The rooms\n\xa0\nThere’s no standard room given that the property is composed of three different buildings from three different periods. But some details are shared, from fringed velvet furnishings, nature-inspired rugs, seashell light fixtures (which nod to the 16th century ornamentation on the hotel’s listed façade), bespoke headboards, solid oak wall lights, manor-style woodwork, and a soft, earthy color palette. The minibar is a compelling decorative\xa0 touch on its own, set inside a dedicated cupboard and features an array of local, gourmet snacks, antiqued wine and cocktail glasses, and an anniversary edition of the 1935 Illy espresso machine for your morning and afternoon coffees. The details, here, make the room. For soaring ceilings, you’ll want to book Prestige Voltaire rooms (either number 25 or 35) but for an altogether unique experience, book the top floor apartment suite, complete with a kitchenette, living room and dining for entertaining, a winter garden and tree-covered terrace designed by the landscape architect Louis Benech, and, of course, a bedroom. It’s no wonder fashion and lifestyle brands have started booking the space for presentations, events, or intimate meals.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0\nEmil, the on-site restaurant, does contemporary bistro fare with a Mediterranean twist (lots of fish and vegetables) but doesn’t come cheap. What amplifies the dining experience is the design of the space—beautiful wood banquettes, tiled floors, elegant marble table tops and stained glass. La Coquille d’Or bar is sexy and intimate, usually filled with a mix of hotel guests and non guests until late.\nThe spa\nA wellness area enveloped in white stone with a private water basin and sauna are available upon request, as are massage treatments.\nThe neighborhood/area\nIn the shadow of the Palais Garnier and the Tuileries Gardens, and quick walks from the Galeries Lafayette department store and the vaulted galleries on rue de Rivoli, it’s an ideal home base for exploring.\nThe service\nWhen you need them, staff are available, helpful, and friendly. Don’t need them? It’ll feel as if you have the “Château” to yourself.\nAnything left to mention?\nWith such a comfortable and inviting fireplace lounge, it’s a shame that the hotel hasn’t implemented a tea time menu. A handful of well-made pastries would go a long way when hotel and outside guests settle in for a warm drink in the late afternoon.']","55 Rue Saint-Roch, Paris 75001, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/paris/chateau-voltaire,https://www.chateauvoltaire.com/en/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2019.",2,"Set in a neoclassical former private residence and surrounded by a sizable structural garden, Paris’s only château-hotel underwent a radical decorative transformation last year—courtesy of Laura Gonzalez, who made it feel like a one-of-a-kind Parisian home once again. The 50 rooms and suites are perfect examples of Gonzalez’s maximalist design style: Think nature-inspired wallpapers, ornate moldings, and plush fabrics in mixed colors and textures. The wellness program also got a total reboot and was relaunched in 2021 as a three-room Guerlain spa, with large vaulted spaces, a stone staircase, and an aesthetic reminiscent of Greco-Roman thermal baths.","['Why book?\n \nParis’s\n only château-hotel makes you feel like you’re socializing in a private club, then overnighting in a private home.', 'Set the scene\n The elegant, primarily residential 16th arrondissement is a fitting location for Saint James Paris, the city’s only officially designated château-hotel. Set in a neoclassical former private residence and surrounded by a sizable structural garden, the property intentionally keeps a low profile—it’s so tucked away, you’d be forgiven for missing it altogether—but once guests arrive, they are instantly drawn in by its soaring volumes, decorative frescoes, and a romantic twist on old-world French elegance (think mixed fabrics, patterns, and colors, panoramic wallpapers, and ornate decorative objects). In each space, from the English-style library bar to rooms and suites, you’ll rub elbows with a mix of in-the-know travelers, fans of Relais & Chateaux hotels (and their focus on exceptional dining) and sophisticated locals who belong to the Saint James Club, a private, members-only outfit that affords priority access to the restaurant and lounge, discounts, and events, among other benefits.', 'The backstory\n Occupying what was once the site of the city’s first hot air balloon landing field (back when the neighborhood was leafy countryside), this former private residence to President Adolphe Thiers eventually became home to the Thiers Foundation, a school and foundation which supported promising students with scholarships and lodging, in 1892. Continuing the tradition of intellectual discourse, the space was transformed into the Saint James Club of Paris, a London-style private club, in the 1980s and the hotel was added about a decade later, with the décor handled by legendary designer Andrée Putman. Since, the property (a member of Relais & Chateaux since 2011) has undergone two other radical decorative transformations, first by Bambi Sloan and most recently by Laura Gonzalez who made it feel like a one-of-a-kind Parisian home once again.', 'The rooms\n Done up with a blend of custom-designed carpets and parquet, nature-inspired wallpapers, ornate chinoiseries and moldings, antiqued objects, and plush fabrics in mixed colors and textures, 51 rooms and suites are both a perfect example of Gonzalez’s maximalist design style and a stunning match for the building’s neoclassical bones. Each room offers a different atmospheric experience according to its dominant patterns and color palette—earthy green and mustardy yellow to terracotta and cream–but it works to harmonious effect. Common to each space are Marshall Bluetooth \nspeakers\n, complimentary water, coffee, and tea, elegant mini-bars stocked with local craft beers and nibbles, and plenty of natural light thanks to skylights or garden views. Bathrooms have either tubs or walk-in showers, in addition to Guerlain amenities.', 'Food and drink\n Under the direction of Executive Chef Julien Dumas (who joined the hotel straight from the Michelin-starred institution Lucas Carton), the Bellefeuille fine dining restaurant, kitted out like a winter garden, serves an inventive, nature-inspired multi-course menu using only seasonal and local ingredients—whether from the closest sea, lake, or the hotel’s own fruit and vegetable gardens located south of the city. Whatever the chef and his team doesn’t make in-house, they source from artisans who operate with a similarly eco-responsible vision, including chef-baker Julien Duboué’s bread and breakfast pastries. Breakfast and lunch are reserved for hotel guests and club members, while dinner is open to all (and fills up fast so book a table in advance). Lunch, snacks, and craft cocktails are served in the Library Bar, surrounded by leather-bound books, deep armchairs, and the original winding staircase from the Thiers Foundation library. When weather permits, meals can be enjoyed under the pergola in the garden.', 'The spa\n The wellness program also got a total reboot and was relaunched in 2021 as a three-room Guerlain spa with large vaulted spaces, a stone staircase and an aesthetic reminiscent of Greco-Roman thermal baths. A 15-meter long bas-relief by François Mascarello lines the swimming pool and offers views of the Parisian skyline. The spa, which is reserved for hotel guests and Club members, also includes a whirlpool, hammam, sauna, and full fitness space.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Between the château setting and posh residential neighborhood, you’ll feel just far enough away from the frenzy of the city but have the benefit of proximity to leading landmarks and museums, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Fondation Louis Vuitton, and on the other side of the Seine, the \nEiffel Tower\n.', 'The service\n The staff are key in creating the private home/club vibe, which they do by being gracious and efficient, but also warm and personal.', 'Eco effort\n Guests have access to complimentary bicycles and (for a fee) can book the house electric car; there’s also an electric car charging station on site. In addition to sourcing from sustainable and artisan purveyors, the chef pulls fruit, vegetables, and honey from the hotel owners’ gardens south of the city.']","5 Place du Chancelier Adenauer, Paris, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/france/neuilly-sur-seine/saint-james-paris,https://www.saint-james-paris.com/en/
InterContinental Paris Le Grand,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2017. Readers' Choice Awards, 2018.",2,"The ornate, Beaux-Arts frame of the InterContinental Paris Le Grand has been around since 1862, when the building was first inaugurated as Le Grand Hotel. Since then, its reputation for grandeur, along with its prime location—just across the avenue from the gilded Palais Garnier, home to the Paris Opera—has made it a magnet for international royalty (Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra, King Edward VII of England) and regular, if well-heeled, folk alike. But it's the buttoned-up Café de la Paix, housed on the ground floor of the hotel, that should shimmy to the top of your to-do list: Not only is the foie gras first-rate, but if you sit out on the terrasse long enough, you might start to soak in the genius of Émile Zola or Guy de Maupassant, just a few of its former patrons.","['Why book?', 'This is a tastefully refreshed \nParisian\n icon facing the Palais Garnier with luxury accommodations and hotel group services but with much gentler prices than the other five-stars nearby. \nSet the scene', 'The covered entrance to this Haussmannian-era dame is as grand as the many city blocks that the property occupies, directly facing the Palais Garnier. That’s clear from the moment you are greeted by the valet and pass the threshold to one of the original homes to Parisian luxury lodging. Weave your way through the foyer, beneath an ornate chandelier and past plush armchairs and thick columns and you’ll reach the broader lobby within view of the hotel’s most iconic feature: the winter garden with its majestic glass canopy, an expansive space where hotel clients, as well as Parisians discussing business, gather for coffee, a light lunch or tea time. As a participating property in the IHG® One Rewards program, you’re likely to spot award travelers from around the world. But given the property’s size—five miles of hallways and 458 rooms since the last 2021 renovation but still with the heft of a liner—it’s also popular among business, cultural and political delegations. During my visit, a massive group from Thailand were staying and participating in events on-site. And given its status as one of few diplomatic hotels in France (approved by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a secure accommodation solution for diplomats and other foreign travelers, complete with armored windows and doors, secure entrances and exits, a panic room, and autonomous telephone lines), it’s likely you’ll cross paths with any number of high-profile guests à la Kamala Harris or John Kerry.', 'The backstory', 'Built at the request of Emperor Napoleon III who had his heart set on building the grandest hotel in Europe, the doors officially opened in 1862 with a gala event hosted by Empress Eugénie. The scale and opulence of the property was unprecedented: 800 rooms, 40 bathrooms, the world’s first hydraulic elevator and hydrotherapy treatments. At the very same time, Napoleon laid the foundation stone for the Palais Garnier, the grand opéra house across the way, sealing the construction of this Haussmannian jewel, which would lord over the Place de l’Opéra in 1875. With that avant garde reputation and modern luxuries, the hotel quickly became the resort of choice for Americans visiting Paris, as well as the world of art and entertainment. By the turn of the century, the hotel was more than living up to the grandeur in its name: it housed a theater ticket office, a travel agency, a post office, a wine cellar, a darkroom for developing photos, and, of course, a gathering place for the world’s creative elites like Josephine Baker, Marlene Dietrich, and Sarah Bernhardt– whose portrait still graces the reception area. The grand ballroom, now called the Salon Opéra, was even said to have inspired Charles Garnier, the opera’s architect. With its 14-meter-high dome, remarkable gilding, arcades, caryatids and candelabras, it’s no wonder the salon is regularly booked for elaborate weddings and special events.', 'Of course, even the grandest of properties needs a makeover from time to time. The most recent refresh was completed by the architect Pierre-Yves Rochon, who was first tasked with restoring the hotel’s Second Empire style in 1985 (and is also known for his work on Four Seasons and Waldorf Astoria properties).', 'The rooms', 'With the latest renovation by Pierre-Yves Rochon, the room count dropped from 470 to 458 rooms, of which 90 are suites. All lean more residential than before. Added to this are Rochon’s five newly created Signature Suites which were designed to feel like chic Parisian apartments, each with a unique aesthetic. The room I stayed in, the Suite Parisienne, sits beneath the rooftops with a dusty pink color palette and themed wallpaper and boasts the \nonly\n unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower in the entire property. The Charles Garnier suite is more sober in its decor, done up in a palette of whites and beiges which allows the Opéra Garnier, in close view from nearly every vantage point, to lend the awe-inspiring touch. The hotel’s historic Presidential suites have retained their classic decor. All rooms feature Byredo amenities, complimentary tea and coffee, and a well-stocked mini bar.', 'Food and drink', 'The Café de la Paix, the hotel’s on-site café that has a long and loyal local clientèle, is perhaps not so much a restaurant as a gilded, historic legend in its own right. Unless you order seafood, there is nothing light about the ultra classic menu: frog legs, Rossini beef with black truffle jus, onion soup based on the café’s original mid-19th-century recipe, apple tart with calvados ice cream, or opera cake for dessert with eye-watering prices given the simplicity of the offering. It is by no means the best hotel restaurant nearby and perhaps a better option for a light starter or for dessert. The Verrière (winter garden) also serves food and wine. But the more interesting on-site F&B option that deserves more attention than it gets is the winter garden bar. It’s where you can try the original Dry Martini, made with Tanqueray gin and Noilly Prat, which was created here in 1904 by head bartender Franck Newman. For a more intimate bar experience, you’ll find an American bar, among the first built in Europe, at the back. Breakfast can be taken in the restaurant or at the Club Lounge. \nThe spa', 'With the latest renovation came an upgrade to the wellness offering, too: a Balmain premium hair salon alongside an Anj Wellness spa. Balmain may seem like an odd choice given the hotel’s aesthetic but the couturier had run many of his fashion shows in the hotel’s salons. There is also a small fitness room with state-of-the-art machines but no pool.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'It’s hard to find a better location than the Place de l’Opéra. Beyond the obvious landmark, the city’s historic department stores—Galeries Lafayette and Printemps—sit a block away, the Palais Royal Gardens and the Louvre are an easy 15-minute walk in the other direction, and the river is a stone’s throw from there.', 'The service', 'Call it five-star service without the pomp and circumstance of most five-stars. The multilingual staff is courteous, young, and very available but doesn’t necessarily exhibit the kind of formality or precious touch of other luxury properties in Paris. \nFor families', 'Given the award rate possibilities and number of rooms that can connect for more space, the hotel is well-suited for families. \nAccessibility', 'ADA standards are met. \nAnything left to mention?', ""On the rue Auber side of the hotel, accessible from inside the hotel or from the street, there's a new location of Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse, a smart one-stop shop for fine chocolates.""]","2 Rue Scribe, Paris,   75009, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/france/paris/intercontinental-paris-le-grand,https://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/us/en/paris/parhb/hoteldetail

Perhaps the most un-Parisian place in the building is the 190 seat Montecito restaurant designed by Humbert & Poyet that channels Palm Springs insouciance; the main dining room is built around a patio with a photo-worthy green wall, and furnishings pop in a refreshing seaside color palette.

Naturally, the design scheme throughout, led by local design darling Charles Zana, elegantly updates the Art Deco style of 1930s luxury hotels.

True to Kimpton style, there’s a clearly American notion of convenience, from the yoga mats in rooms and the “forgot it, we got it” amenities like toothpaste, portable phone chargers, and even a little sex kit.\nFood and drink\n\xa0\nPerhaps the property’s most un-Parisian place of all is the 190 seat Montecito restaurant designed by Humbert & Poyet that channels Palm Springs insouciance.

The Cali-inspired menu, with dishes you’re not likely to find at other Parisian hotels such as fish tacos, crab cakes, and Huevos Rancheros for breakfast, was co-created by American recipe developer and author Carrie Solomon. It all makes for an ideal spot to dine for travelers who prefer an experience that mixes Parisian and International sensibilities. In spring and summer, the Sequoia rooftop bar opens for best-in-class views of the entire skyline and excellent craft cocktails (yoga classes take place on the rooftop in the warmer months, too). And in true Kimpton fashion, there’s a daily complimentary social hour at the hotel at 5 p.m. with drinks and nibbles.', 'The spa\n\xa0\nFor such a large property, it’s a bit of a shame that the Codage spa and pool occupy such a small area (two treatment rooms). Still, the pool packs a relaxing punch and is worth packing your favorite bathing suit.\xa0\nThe neighborhood/area\nIt’s hard to get more historic than the Boulevard des Capucines, a stone’s throw from the Opéra house, the Place Vendôme and the Church of the Madeleine, and a short walk from the Palais Royal Gardens and the Louvre.

The double-height Art Deco lobby buzzes with impeccably dressed locals here for pre-dinner cocktails at Bar Josephine.', ""What's the story?\nParis’s singular Left Bank palace hotel, dates back to 1910. In the '20s, Andre Gide dined here daily; both Picasso and Matisse called it home. The writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was a regular guest, as was James Joyce, who played Irish ballads on the piano in the bar where Josephine Baker ushered Paris into the Jazz Age. The original Romanesque frescoes in Bar Josephine were discovered and painstakingly restored by Paris architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte."", 'What can we expect in our room?\nSome of the rooms face Boulevard Raspail and Rue de Sèvres, and from truly bijou balconies, views stretch beyond to the \nEiffel Tower\n. Navy walls bordered in white resemble a ship’s stateroom; courtyard-facing rooms are decorated in neutral greys. Dark chevron parquet floors; Hermès silk pillows decorate the cozy Art Deco-style furniture by Poltrona Frau. Decadently oversized by Paris standards, bathtubs—carved out of a single block of marble—are reason enough to upgrade to the higher room categories. Tech was easy to master, and intuitive.', ""How about the food and drink? What's on offer?\nFour bars and restaurants, including one outdoors. Chef Patrick Charvet, a veteran of Michelin-starred kitchens, created the menus at the marble-, glass- and wood-clad Lutetia Brasserie; the sea bar, with its poached langoustines and oysters soaked in aloe vera, has had rave reviews. In Bar Josephine, caviar toasted sandwiches are made with 30 grams of Osciètre caviar, and inspiring cocktails use outlier ingredients like fennel, rhubarb, and ginseng honey."", 'Anything to say about the service?\nCheck-in was smooth; but service at breakfast was slow and a little old-school. The doormen are fantastic, helping to carry shopping bags and hailing cabs in the rain, with the utmost grace.', 'Who comes here?\nHigh-profile loyalists from politics, arts, and fashion. Denizens of Saint-Germain-des-Prés—Catherine Deneuve and Charlotte Gainsbourg among them—counted down to the reopening of their regular \nboîte de nuit\n. And anyone not actually famous will be dressed to fit in among them—in black, of course, accessorized with orange shopping bags from the Hermès boutique next door.', ""What's the neighborhood scene like?\nOvernight, this Art Deco landmark went back to being key to the Saint-Germain-des-Prés scene. It's a two-minute walk to \nLe Bon Marché\n, five to the fabulous people watching and \nchocolat chaud\n at Les Deux Magots, and is surrounded by real Paris restaurants. On Sunday mornings there’s an organic market outside on the Boulevard Raspail, where Kristin Scott Thomas gets her veg."", ""And anything you'd change?\nThe temperamental lifts; the staff at breakfast.

Hotel Les Deux Gares,"Hot List, 2021.",1,"It’s hard to imagine that a single corner of the French capital has been left unexplored by hoteliers over the past decade. But, as proven by Adrien Gloaguen’s latest spot in unsung Little India, there are still overlooked pockets to be happened upon. When he first visited the site, then a glum two-star number, and saw the skyline views over the train tracks linking two of the city’s main stations, he knew that he could make something special of it—and that the right person for the job would be British wunderkind Luke Edward Hall. The interior designer’s first hotel project is full of joy, with nods to the past everywhere but also contemporary excitement. The Haussmann-style corner building is awash with bold color combinations, which is what drew the creative crowd who booked out the place even before it opened. “It’s my own, very personal and playful take on Parisian style,” says Hall. French antiques sit next to mid-century lamps; checkerboard contrasts with leopard print, and there are seventies geometric carpets alongside Art-Deco details. Edward Hall also transformed the tired bar across the street into the Café Les Deux Gares. The bistro already has a following of locals and food writers who feast on a lunch menu of plates, such as succulent pork loin with beetroot, washed down with natural wines. It takes a bold move to persuade savvy travelers to loiter near the stations, but the duo behind this hotel have cracked it.","['Set the scene:\n On a quiet backstreet of \nParis’s\n bustling Little India, where the sweet scent of curries simmering in restaurant kitchens hangs in the air, is a six-story limestone corner building that glints in the stark white daylight. Trains rumble past below street level and pull into the Gare de l’Est, one of the city’s oldest train stations (the Gare du Nord is just around the corner, hence the name). This is the first hotel designed by Luke Edward Hall, after the opening was delayed due to Covid; check in at the reception desk tucked behind a perspex screen before scurrying off to snap the bold-hued rooms for Insta Reels. The hotel has Hall’s playful optimism splashed all over, putting the dismal weather outside, and the pandemic, on hold—at least for the night.', 'What’s the story?\n When hotelier Adrien Gloaguen visited this faded station hotel, he saw the potential in the simple Haussmannian-style corner building overlooking the railway right away. With three other popular hotel locations in the city already (\nPanache\n, Beaurepaire, and \nBienvenue\n), Gloaguen was quick to snag one of the hottest designers of the moment, cleverly commissioning his first hotel project. Hall effortlessly flits between styles and patterns to create a color-splashed world that’s theatrical and yet welcoming. Here, he aimed to create intrigue through a Brit-meets-French atmosphere: “I wanted it to feel like the home of an eccentric Parisian bohemian who, over the years, has amassed a collection of furniture and \nart\n from his travels, from various periods and countries,” he says. “I wanted the interiors to feel full of joy, with a nod to the past.” And it works wonderfully well throughout. For instance, in the lobby he pairs leopard-print and electric-blue sofas with toile de Jouy wallpaper and candy-stripe curtains, tied together with vintage posters for the walls and other decorative items he’s sourced from auctioneers and flea markets.', 'What can we expect in our room?\n While a handful of the 40 rooms are more generous in size, most are on the small side (quite common for boutique hotels in Paris). Guests are here, though, for a taste of Hall’s flair for mixing prints and colors you never thought possible. You won’t find a single muted tone in the place—in fact, you’d be hard pushed to find a white surface. Even the ceilings are painted in bold shades such as yellow or pink. Candy-stripe headboards sit with velvet mid-century French-style armchairs and ottomans. The bathrooms have to be our favorite feature, with their loud colors and snazzy vintage ceramic sinks ordered from the Bold Bathroom Company. Rooms on the fifth floor all have balconies from which to admire the unconventional views of Gare de l’Est’s train tracks, open skies (a rare sight in Europe’s second-most densely populated city) and Haussmannian buildings that line the adjacent street. If you look hard enough, you might even catch a curious local or two peeking from behind the curtains, intrigued by their new neighbor.', 'How about the food and drink?\n Craft coffee and buttery croissants are served each morning in the breakfast nook at the back of the lobby. The real showstopper, though, is the Café Les Deux Gares across the street, which has a centuries-old feel, even if it was entirely gutted and redesigned by Hall. Previously a drab bar made to look like the interior of an old French train carriage, it has transformed into an attractive bistro that draws a crowd of locals who work in the area and food journalists who have made it their new go-to. The result is a light and airy space with discrete Art Deco touches such as the lighting fixtures, and marble-topped tables and wooden chairs, finished with a moody trompe l’oeil tortoiseshell ceiling by artist Pauline Leyravaud, who was enlisted by Hall. There’s a kind of joy here and it’s because of the atmosphere but also the food. Driven by quality produce, chefs Jonathan Schweizer and Federico Suárez create seasonal menus of homely classics, which change daily. Even the simplest of dishes, such as egg mayonnaise topped with crunchy samphire and mains of succulent pork loin with juicy whole beetroot, is worth ordering. The best part is that the lunch menu, at only $28 for three courses, is reason enough to keep you in the area past lunchtime, with a good selection of natural wines to linger over.', 'Anything to say about the service?\n The staff are laid-back but approachable, which gives guests the freedom to make the place their own without their every move being scrutinized.', 'What sort of person stays here?\n A design-savvy crowd who know when they’re onto a good thing, and curious travelers who shun list-ticking in favor of a more authentic experience; an offbeat location in this case, which works to expand your knowledge of a city, regardless of how many times you’ve visited.', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?\n The hotel’s street, with its a clutch of Indian sweet shops, is quiet, but that’s not the case for the rest of the neighborhood, which is packed with South Indian restaurants, supermarkets, and sari shops—a perfect starting point to get to know multicultural Paris. Once you’ve sampled lip-smacking good dosa and idli with spicy coconut chutney, stroll 10 minutes south to the Poissonnière area or east to Canal Saint-Martin for a change of scene. Trade Indian restaurants for trendy boutiques selling the latest apparel, and Insta-worthy bars and restaurants such as the bustling Comptoir Général and its African desert-lodge style, or the \nVerre Volé\n wine bar where you can sample natural wines from the south. Alternatively, in the warmer months, pack a bottle of wine, cheese and a crusty baguette to enjoy canalside like the locals do (Covid-allowing, of course).', 'Anything you’d change?\n We’d add plantlife to the fifth-floor balconies, but according to the staff it’s already in the pipeline.', 'Anything we missed?\n The sauna and gym with its red and white checkerboard floor and eye-popping lilac and lime green Svenskt Tenn floral wallpaper.', 'Is it worth it? Why?\n Rates are a bargain by Paris standards, where a room with the slightest design flair will usually set you back double the price at least. The same also applies to the wonderful Café Les Deux Gares. The Little India location puts a more local spin on Paris while being within a 10-minute walk to the city’s trendiest areas.']","2 Rue des Deux Gares, Paris 75010, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/paris/hotel-les-deux-gares,https://hoteldeuxgares.com/

After entering the marble lobby and craning my neck upward to take in the leafy courtyard garden and cascading greens from the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, I felt transported out of Paris and into a more contemporary city where the past isn\'t brandished quite so heavily as a selling point. Makes sense that this is a the Mandarin, an Asian group with different codes for luxury. ""Another elegance"" is what I said to myself the first time I visited the hotel.

Hôtel Le Grand Mazarin,,3,"Le Grand Mazarin is the fourth in a budding collection of high-profile properties from Maisons Pariente, which includes Crillon-le-Brave in Provence, Le Coucou in Méribel and Lou Pinet in Saint-Tropez, and the first urban hotel for the group. Atmospheric could suitably describe all of the group’s hotels but Le Grand Mazarin is the most eclectic and maximalist of them all—a result of the Swedish designer Martin Brudnizki’s singular touch. And while it would be fair to assume the hotel’s name or location were somehow inspired by Louis XIV's famous minister, Cardinal Mazarin, the connection is related instead to a feature of his time—the literary salons that proliferated during the 17th century and saw the era’s greatest thinkers, performers, and artists gather in lavish locales to dialogue and indulge. It’s hard to beat chef Assaf Granit’s award-winning team when it comes to food and wine, and a Wes Anderson meets Alice in Wonderland literary-salon vibe is most apparent in each of the 50 guest rooms and 11 suites; some of which boast private balconies with views of the BHV/Marais and the neighborhood.","['Why book?', 'This is a great option for design aficionados and food lovers keen on intimate bohemian spaces but not the usual \nParisian\n grandeur. Le Grand Mazarin is an ideal in-between, smack in the middle of the spectrum of indie boutique hotels and palatial luxury hotels, plus plenty of opportunities to rub elbows with locals who come to drink and dine.', 'Set the scene', 'At first glance, it seems like a curious location for what is meant to be a grand hotel. The property sits on the corner of rue des Archives and rue de la Verrerie, directly across from the BHV / Marais department. The frenetic rue de Rivoli and the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) sit one block south and pedestrians scurry about in all directions. And yet, what you discover upon entering is a cocoon that breaks from the urban din, and one that looks markedly different from any other premium Parisian property. The whimsical design by Martin Brudnizki and his London-based Design Studio MBDS takes French classicism and boldly shakes it up with shocks of color (jade is a recurring and dominant hue) and mixed motifs. It all feels like Wes Anderson meets \nAlice in Wonderland\n to delightful effect. That extends not only to rooms and common areas but to the ground floor cocktail bar and the Michelin-starred chef Assaf Granit’s ode to Ashkenaze cuisine at Boubalé, the hotel’s restaurant (the name is a Yiddish term of endearment typically used by Ashkenazi grandmothers). Not only does it reflect the chef’s own heritage and that of the hotel group’s owners, Leslie Kouhana et Kimberley Cohen Pariente, it nods to the centuries-long Jewish history of the Marais neighborhood itself.', 'All of that combined has made Boubalé the hot-ticket table to book, with each seating packed full with families, sharply-dressed hotel guests and travelers, along with Isabel Marant-wearing 30 somethings who request seats at the chef’s counter to watch Granit and his precise but zenned-out chefs orchestrate the meal.', 'The backstory', ""Le Grand Mazarin is the fourth in a budding collection of high-profile properties from Maisons Pariente, which includes \nCrillon-le-Brave\n in Provence, \nLe Coucou\n in Méribel and \nLou Pinet\n in Saint-Tropez, and the first urban hotel for the group.

Among the 500 works of art intelligently selected by Amélie du Chalard and placed in common areas and guest rooms, guests will find pictorial art given particular attention: There’s the trompe-l'oeil windows of the patio, decorated with phantasmagorical drawings by the Minorcan artist Sophia Pega; there’s plant motifs by Ateliers Gohard on the bar and restaurant ceilings; and most strikingly, there’s an ethereal fresco by Jacques Merle that runs from the pool’s vaulted ceiling down to its columns, largely inspired by the world of Jean Cocteau. \nThe rooms"", 'That Wes Anderson meets Alice in Wonderland literary salon vibe is most apparent in each of the 50 guest rooms and 11 suites, some of which boast private balconies with views of the BHV/Marais and the neighborhood. All are understandably different in shape and layout due to the historic, 14th century structure they occupy but that only adds to the charm. Brudnizki’s twist on French classicism uses disparate motifs, colors, and fabrics that sit comfortably together, further supported by the craftsmanship of the talented artisans he brought on to execute each piece, many of whom work for companies bearing the French Living Heritage label (\nEntreprises du Patrimoine Vivant\n). Manufacture Pinton 1867 is behind the plush carpets, Maison Pierre Frey for quirky fabrics, and Maison Lucien Gau, known for the bronze lighting it has produced for 6 generations, designed custom lamps with hand-decorated legs and shades designed by two different artists, Laura Horrocks and Claudia Cauville. The decor varies by room but there are a few common threads: the room setup is arranged around a grandiose bed over which an Aubusson-style tapestry, made by Art de Lys, provides a canopy. Mini bars feature locally-sourced snacks, coffee capsules from Café Joyeux—a French coffee shop chain that employs people with disabilities—and a selection of beauty products like Tata Harper and Augustinus Bader curated by the Parisian concept store Oh My Cream, all of which can be ordered and delivered by a butler service to rooms within 30 minutes. And Diptyque bath products line the vanity in each and every bathroom. \nFood and drink', 'It’s hard to beat chef Assaf Granit’s award-winning team when it comes to food and wine. Already behind the one Michelin-star Shabour, Tekés (vegetarian), Shana, and the freshly reopened Kapara (formerly Balagan), Granit’s group JLM Machneyuda adds Boubalé to its mini global empire. It’s also the first restaurant in the group to attempt an Israeli take on ashkenazi cuisine (the menu takes liberties that couldn’t be considered truly ashkenazi such as seafood kneidlach or matzo balls) with a few other dishes inspired by Moroccan, Syrian, or Iraqi Sephardic cooking which many of his cooks grew up with eating and preparing firsthand. While you won’t see gefilte fish on the menu, you’ll find brisket paired with gnocchi, generous servings of challah with crème fraîche and tomato, yellowtail fish in a horseradish marinade, liver pâté, and a babka mousse that’s not to be missed. (The hotel breakfast is served in the same dining room and runs from Continental to Levantine, with babka French toast that can usually be ordered off-menu).

Monsieur George Hotel & Spa,"Hot List, 2020.",2,"Greek magnate Umbert Saltiel religiously went to Blake’s Hotel in London, Anouska’s Hempel’s first hotel, which she opened in 1978, every week for years on end. When it came to transforming his own latest hotel, in a handsome Hausmann building in Paris just a beat from the Champs-Élysées, he wanted no one else. His son, Nicolas, tracked down the onetime Bond Girl-turned-designer, otherwise known as Lady Weinberg, and convinced her to take on the project. And as ever, she doesn’t do things by half. Her exacting attention to detail is obvious everywhere—""If you’re alive, you have to try and be the best,"" she says—in a riot of jade, emerald, and forest green, black lacquered paint, chevron tiles, and marble, and so many mirrors your perspective shifts as you move. A small but cleverly constructed space, the 46 rooms are spread over six floors. Décor is a mishmash of Anoushka’s travels. Moroccan in essence, offset with Indian lanterns and ikat prints from Romania; moody and sultry. Lady Weinberg is so obsessed with lighting, she added a Perspex filter to light bulbs by the bed to achieve the perfect soft glow. In the basement, cult Parisian yoga and wellness club Le Tigre doles out soothing massages, while restaurant Galanya looks to Asia with yellowtail sashimi, prawn ravioli, beef tataki, and cod with Japanese mushrooms cooked with precision. Much like the entire hotel, nothing is an accident or left to chance; it’s an orchestra of taste, all conducted by Lady Weinberg herself.

It took three years from start to finish, with Hempel putting the French production team through their paces with her exacting standards every step of the way.', 'Set the scene.', 'Piles of fashion books in reception, velvet chairs, gigantic fans in the window and exotic potted plants set the razzle dazzle scene instantly. Rooms are decorated in four different styles: Chequers, Windsor, Benjamin Franklin, and Marly; collectively they create an image of a modern Fitzgerald novel, all classic Hempel; lavish, contrasting fabrics from plush satin to taffeta. The color scheme is strict; greys, biscuit, ebony, and lots of deep greens, bar a respite from the top-floor rooms which are refreshingly (and shockingly for Hempel) white-on-white. The beds are ridiculously comfortable, while bathrooms are defined by crittall windows and sliding lighting (which is, in fact, a huge deal for Hempel—she’s added a Perspex filter to bedside lamps and fought tooth and nail for just the right dim glow throughout the entire hotel).', 'What can we expect in our room?', 'Thick padded slippers, small wardrobes, gorgeous views of Rue Washington below, heavy-to-lift draped velvet curtains. And mirrors. Lots of mirrors. Plus, a mini bar high on drinks, low on snacks.', 'How about the food and drink?', 'Off the lobby, the Galangal restaurant serves a limited menu of Asian-inspired fare like cod fish yellow curry for dinner, plus a daytime menu that spans from Croque Monsieurs and Caesar salads to buckwheat ramen with smoked tofu. Featuring both set and a la carte menus, Sunday brunch, served year-round in the restaurants or on the terrace, is a lively affair that’s a hit with families. Start your days with breakfast (there are three prix fixe options available in the restaurant, or you can get room service), then end them in the cool mirrored bar, where the classic cocktails are made with homemade elixirs. Hempel’s tipple of choice is a Whiskey Sour, but there’s also a wine cellar with tables and chairs where people fall on cheese platters and clarets of Bordeaux.', 'What’s the crowd like?', 'Smart. Well-turned out affluent French locals, and those operating in the elevated Hempel (who also bears the title Lady Weinberg) world. Many come for the specialized food and wine, though it’s also a draw for couples as the lighting is so low and the space small it instantly feels sultry and romantic.', 'Anything to say about the service?', 'Like the entire operation, it’s exacting. Every member of staff will know your name, and if you have an obscure request, they’ll fulfill it for you. On the double. Acting as if Lady Weinberg is watching over their shoulder for a slip up.', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?', 'The street is classic Paris (Rue Washington with its tabacs and chocolate shops) found on the right bank in the heart of the 8th district. Art museums aplenty nearby (most notable is the\xa0\nGrand Palais\n) along with the Champs-Élysées’ shiny office fronts, shops, and cafés packed with tourists.', 'Anything else to add?', 'Book a massage in the spa; it’s like being engulfed in a glorious cocoon for over an hour. (The wellness area also has a steam and sauna; private yoga sessions can be set up in your room.) And do order room service, as standards don’t slip from restaurant to bed.

Cour des Vosges,"Hot List, 2020.",3,"On the Monopoly board of Paris, there could be no address smarter than the Place des Vosges in the Marais. It’s the city’s oldest and prettiest square: Louis XIII and Anne of Austria celebrated their engagement here in 1612; it was the site of trysts and duels during the 17th and 18th centuries; and in 1832 the great writer Victor Hugo moved into number six, overlooking the pleached lime trees and fountain-punctuated lawns. Across at number 19, the heavy unmarked door doesn’t give any clue that it conceals one of Paris’s most intriguing new arrivals. Cour des Vosges takes the now familiar home-as-hotel set-up and elevates it gloriously but discreetly. It marks a clear departure for Evok Hôtels, whose other haunts (Sinner, Brach) are more showy and dramatic.

What's the vibe?\nBlink and you might miss the entrance; apart from one modest sign, there is little that signals you've arrived at this hotel. Buzz at the large wooden door to enter an intimate courtyard, where you'll be ushered into the building by hotel staff. Once inside, it feels more like a guesthouse than a standard hotel: there's no lobby or formal reception desk. The first thing you see is a grand staircase and an elevator, and to the left, the back entrance to the hotel's tea salon. It's all very confidential and intimate which, if you've booked this place, is what you're after."", ""What's the backstory?\nThis is the newest opening from Evok Hôtels, which is best known for its buzzier, showier properties, including \nBrach\n, Sinner, and \nNolinksi\n. The group never takes over hotels, but rather, creates hotels from buildings in need of an overhaul. In this case, the building was once a school and more recently a textile warehouse—nothing resembling its royal origins. Lecoadic & Scotto architecture redesigned the space with the help of Bâtiments de France. Given the structure's historic landmark status, preserving heritage was of utmost importance."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nTalk about grand (that might be the high ceilings)! Entering the superior suite (one step down from the suite de luxe) was akin to entering an apartment, if that apartment were imagined entirely by an art collector with keen design sensibilities. It's hard to miss the four-poster bed with its aluminum alcove, and the sleek kitchenette on the left. Floor-to-ceiling windows, double-paned with blown glass à l'ancienne, reveal the \nPlace des Vosges\n and its leafy Louis XIII square. This is the only property that offers such views from all rooms. Hand-painted wooden beams were discovered during the renovation, though the designers couldn't interfere with or touch them in any way; as a result, the bathroom is obscured by a black-ribbed screen, a sort of homage to the sculptor Pierre Soulages. Marble and glass surfaces abound, as do velvet fabrics, rugs, and exposed (original) terra cotta floors. The space is sexy and chic, a masterful mix of heritage style and 1970s design."", 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nFree Wi-Fi! No issues at all.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThere's no formal restaurant or bar but there is a tea salon on the ground floor, which is also open to the public until 8 p.m. It's an annex of \nLe Brach\n hotel's restaurant and is called Le Brach - Pâtisserie by Yann Brys. All of the pastries and breakfast items are made by Meilleur Ouvrier de France Yann Brys. Le Brach's savory-food chef is also in charge of the light canteen menu here. After-hours, the food can be ordered in-room and ranges from quiches to terrine and comforting stews. I loved the fact that the pastry chef was the draw, not the chef de cuisine. It also means that while the experience overall at the hotel is about discretion and privacy, there is at least one space where guests can potentially mingle with locals—that is, on the terrace of this tea salon."", ""And the service?\nExcellent service—non-invasive but helpful and respectful. Check-in happens in the room which makes everyone's life easier. Every staff member plays the role of concierge and can be tapped for advice, insights, and recommendations, including unique and under-the-radar experiences and tours of the city."", 'What type of travelers will you find here?\nAn experienced world-traveler who is no longer interested in scenes or conspicuous displays of wealth or expertise. Their simplicity in dress masks their tremendous success. They may be the CEO of a company, a beloved actor, a respected artist, or a well-known designer, but they all want the same thing: privacy.', ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\nThe hotel blends neatly into the soft landscape of Place des Vosges, known for its public garden and red-brick pavilions. It's the only hotel to offer direct views of the space, itself a destination, making it an ideal location for travelers looking to be in the heart of the city but just removed enough from the bustle."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nI'd forgo the plastic Guerlain amenities in the bathroom and opt for a more sustainable option. At the hotel's scale, it can be done."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\nThere are two electric bikes available for guests; everything else is an add-on. Devialet Phantom speakers in each room are a \nvery\n nice touch. Music lovers will appreciate such quality sound.', ""Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\nOne-hundred percent. It's got all the trappings of high luxury with the benefit of privacy and royal gardens at your doorstep.""]","19 Place des Vosges, Paris 75004, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/paris/cour-des-vosges,https://courdesvosges.com/

That begins with the design by RDAI that goes hard on retro-futurism and decorative touches informed by the surrounding environment, like Parisian cobblestones and the Seine river. The terrazzo flooring with marble inserts, soaring volumes, and striking mushroom-shaped pillars make the first big impression once you’re through the door, then the eye catches the contemporary art works, like the vibrant tondo painting by the French-Algerian artist \nNeïl Belouf\na, and the amber glass mirrored walls. By then, one of the staff dressed head-to-toe in Breton stripes in funky hues designed by Guillaume Henry, the artistic director of Patou, has welcomed you with a detox juice or zero-proof cocktail and kicked off a very different kind of Parisian stay. \nThe backstory', 'The location in what locals would have called an absolute \nnothing\n of a neighborhood is what makes the property so compelling. Nicknamed L’Arsenal today, the area used to be an island, much like nearby Île de la Cité and the Ile Saint Louis. The Île Louviers, as it was known in the 18th century, was leased to lumber merchants who stockpiled their timber. Louis Philippe had it filled in and connected to the rive droite (right bank) in 1841 but the land’s next biggest change wouldn’t come until the 1960s when it was transformed into a modernist administrative complex. Though technically part of the Marais, this pocket between the Place de la Bastille and the river was never a destination; it was residential and sleepy at best until 2022 when a substantial urban revitalization project saw the complex overhauled by British architect David Chipperfield. The SO/ Hotel shares the site with an art gallery, several restaurants, a trendy youth hostel, a bakery, and residences.

RDAI gave rooms a colorful palette with shimmering tones, warm woods, ceramics, and thoughtful details like coffee tables that double as tray tables, a spirits cabinet, a Bluetooth speaker in the shape of a bulldog and a minibar stocked with locally-sourced snacks. Codage beauty products can be found in the en suite bathroom and there, be mesmerized by the sizable shower with some of the best and consistent water pressure of any Parisian hotel shower. Truly something to behold.', 'Food and drink', 'The restaurant group Paris Society manages the room service and on-site restaurant \nBonnie\n, where breakfast is also served, which should tell you something if you’re familiar with the group’s other establishments: the ambience, views, and crowd takes priority over the menu. The food is solid if expensive and won’t be delivering any transformative dining experiences. But that isn’t the point—the retro-chic dining room and absolutely jaw-dropping views are why you’re here in the first place. You will, however, find some French classics like sole meunière and foie gras with toasted brioche, lobster linguini, and a massive veal chop for two alongside American items like crab cakes, caesar salade, chicken with buffalo wing sauce, and a very good Angus ribeye steak to share. (You’ll also want to go in on the fries and macaroni and cheese). The bar and Studio 54-inspired nightclub have similarly stellar views of the entire city and attract a crowd that doesn’t balk at dressing up. \nThe spa', 'A small but excellent Codage spa is run separately from the hotel (much like the fitness center and pool– free for guests to access but do call ahead) on the lower level of the building. There aren’t many treatment rooms so make your request when you check-in.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'That formerly sleepy neighborhood of L’Arsenal is only slightly less sleepy today but it does connect guests easily to public transport, to the river, and to the more lively parts of the Marais where you’ll find independent shops, the BHV/Marais department store, city hall, and the Institut du Monde Arabe, a quick jaunt over the Pont de Sully.', 'The service', 'You can expect relaxed but still attentive service when it comes to the reception desk and room management and a bit more of that storied Parisian sass when it comes to the restaurant.', 'For families', 'Given the see-and-be-seen crowd, this isn’t the ideal spot to book as a family but a handful of rooms can accommodate children. \nAccessibility', 'All ADA standards are met and animals are permitted. \nAnything left to mention?', 'Pay attention to the thematic pop-up corner before you hit the elevator corridor.

For those in search of ultimate privacy, the top floor duplex 7,000 square-foot Quintessence Suite comes with four ensuite bedrooms, a 41-foot private swimming pool, projection space, panoramic terrace and a hefty price tag– as should be expected from one of the largest penthouses in Paris.', 'Food and drink', 'Across the hall from the seventh-floor contemporary brasserie and bar Le Tout-Paris, Langosteria (the first to open outside of Milan) is a draw for Italian fine dining and a playful ambiance.

Yet there was general astonishment when, in 2015, La Réserve Paris sashayed into town, teaching the city’s grandes dames new tricks. It's the most beloved address in the French capital for fashion editors and the go-to for regular visitors to the city who want to feel like they’re staying in a private mansion, with just 40 rooms in a fine hôtel particulier designed by Baron Haussmann for Napoleon III’s half-brother the Duc de Morny in 1854. Its position, on a quiet, tree-lined street moments from the Place de la Concorde, is propitious. Then you cross the threshold and—ka-boom!—it’s an explosion of color and texture in the best way imaginable. There’s brocade taffeta, velvet drapes and silk wallpapers in the richest shades of emerald and ruby. No crevice has gone ungilded. This is somewhere you'll want to come back to time and again. —Steve King","['So, what are we in for here?\nParis\n, you might have thought, is a city that needs more unutterably grand, stirringly romantic, and deliciously atmospheric five-star hotels about as much as it needs more haughtily elegant ladies with dogs that fit into their handbags. The arrival of La Réserve in 2015 proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was room for at least one more—this one.', 'Past the Haussmann-style façade and a fiery red door, you enter a world where refined 19th-century elegance is married with thoroughly modern details. Opened in 2015, in a mansion that once belonged to the Napoleon’s step-brother, the Duc of Morny, La Réserve Paris was designed by interiors guru Jacques Garcia with his signature style, resulting in lots of velvet drapery, silk damask walls, gilt frames, and herringbone parquet floors. The public areas encourage getting comfortable, with long, pillow-strewn sofas, and plush upholstered club chairs set around ornate fireplaces and shelves lined with over 3,000 antique books; an intimate garden lounge makes the city seem far away, though the property is just off the Champs-Élysées and Avenue Montaigne. The dreamy opulence is balanced by electronic check-in and, up in the rooms, iPad control centers for temperature, lighting, and entertainment.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nWith its boutique size and five-star services, the hotel appeals to travelers who know Paris well and want to be in the heart of it all, but also stay under-the-radar.', 'Now, onto the good stuff: Tell us about the digs.\nThe décor varies in the 40 rooms (over half of which are suites), but is generally a touch more sedate that the lobby spaces, with crisp, unadorned beds accented by velvet arm chairs, hand-picked antiques, and billowing damascene brocade taffetas. Many have views of city landmarks from their floor-to-ceiling windows or private terraces.', ""How about the little things, like the mini bar, or shower goodies? What were the amenities that really made your stay?\nIt’s the details that take center stage, from linens monogrammed with guest’s initials and a jewelry box in the hotel’s signature deep red to separate colors for men’s and women’s bathrobes (slate for him, blush for her), and hand weights and stretch bands supplied for in-room workouts. Mini-bars feature wine from one of the hotel owner's estates. Each room has a dedicated butler who will make sure bedside tables are topped with books from your favorite writers, draw you a bath, or help with packing, and who can also arrange special experiences like in-suite private concerts, couture fittings, and custom perfume making sessions."", 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nAwash in natural light, the spacious bathrooms are done-up in Carrara and Turquin blue marble, and feature double vanities and separate tubs and Italian showers.', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi.

Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe recreational offerings are substantial, given the intimate size of the hotel: there's a 52-foot lap pool, a gym with personal trainer, and a three-room spa offering customized treatments using the Nescens-Swiss anti-aging line. The two-Michelin-star Le Gabriel interprets classic French fine dining with Japanese flair, while La Pagode de Cos reinterprets dishes from around the world in a room gilded with carved woodwork and an oversized fireplace. Unveiled in 2021, the gorgeous Duc de Mornay Library is exclusive to hotel guests in the morning, then opens to everyone else for lunch on the patio or around the fire, tea in the afternoon (perhaps paired with one of the over 3,000 books that line the shelves) and drinks from the honor bar through the evening. Be sure to try some Bordeaux from the hotel owner’s vineyards, an don’t miss the “secret” door to the smoking room and its selection of 400 cigars. Finally, the Bar Le Gaspard, a favorite with locals, features an extensive wine and cocktail list, and bartenders who can create a personal drink to your tastes—and who'll remember the recipe for the next time."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nWith all the luxury trappings of a larger hotel, but the warm, personalized feeling of staying in a private mansion, this is a place you'll want to come back to time and again.""]","42 Avenue Gabriel, Paris 75008, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/paris/paris/la-reserve-paris-hotel-and-spa,https://www.lareserve-paris.com/en/

Hôtel des Grands Boulevards,"Hot List, 2018.",2,"The third hotel from Paris’s charmingly raffish Experimental Group, who opened the cheeky Grand Pigalle and London’s perky Henrietta after establishing cocktail bars around the world, may be the most irresistible yet. The Hôtel des Grands Boulevards is tucked away in the 2nd Arrondissement, one of the most diverse and dynamic parts of the city. It’s where to find ornate theaters and arcades as well as whimsical textile workshops, and a healthily quirky dose of les flaneurs moving between them all. Staying at this converted 18th-century townhouse places guests properly amongst the muck, and with three bars and restaurants from which to watch the daily life unfold with an elderflower cocktail in hand, naturally. Interior designer Dorothee Meilichzon took her cues from the neighborhood when decking out the 50 rooms with textures, shapes, and colors. Petite guestrooms have luscious greens, blues, and pinks; against this palette the plump all-white beds seem like fluffy, cozy clouds. Tiny wooden stools near windows with ball-gown length drapes create the atmosphere of a Parisian parlor. Though when the bustle of the 2nd all gets a little too much, the ideal escape is on the rooftop, where gin joint The Shed serves a mean vodka with lemongrass to young locals who will no doubt be dressed better than yourself. Paris rarely feels as fun as it does from the inside of a hotel run by a bunch of bartenders.","['Set the scene for us.\nUnexpected and romantic. This is rather different for Paris, both in its bustling commercial boulevard position and the blink-and-you-miss-it passageway entrance. It feels like stepping into an alternate universe, leaving the din of the street behind for a leafy walkway, then an exquisite, glass-covered courtyard dining room. It’s bigger and more beautiful than it looks.', 'What’s the story behind it?\nThis is the second Paris property from the Experimental Group, the cocktail-kings-turned-hoteliers known for their Bed and Beverage hotels in France (Grand Pigalle, L’Experimental Chalet), England (\nHenrietta Hotel\n) and Il Palazzo Experimental in Venice. As with all these, the design of the Grands Boulevards revisits the history of the building and its particular location: a pre-Revolution structure on the cusp of bourgeois and provincial Paris. The group’s go-to designer Dorothée Meilichzon translated that past by mixing a (pared back) Louis XVI style with more rustic elements such as wooden stools and nightstands.', 'What can we expect from our room?\nRustic linen, worn wood furniture, bronze sconces, and best of all, the most comfortable bed of any boutique hotel—the group works exclusively with an artisanal mattress maker in Brittany and it makes a world of difference. Even the smallest rooms are cozy, and some even have a private balcony or terrace, but the best use of space can be found in the Parisian Eaves room, just underneath the rooftop with exposed beams.', 'How about the food and drink?\nThe Shell cocktail bar is one of the big draws here, even for Parisians. It’s tiny with low stools and short armchairs which means you won’t linger over drinks all evening but then you can move to the restaurant and have a meal (the menu is overseen by chef Giovanni Passerini) and finish with a nightcap at the rooftop bar The Shed. The glass-canopy dining room feels far more relaxing at breakfast. Despite having Passerini’s name attached to the kitchen, the results are inconsistent and a little underwhelming.', 'Anything to say about the service?\nFriendly and warm when needed but staff remains largely at a nice, comfortable remove. Long delays in the dining room, however, are a different story.', 'Who comes here?\nIn-the-know American and European millennials—some on their Paris stop on a jaunt across Europe, others clearly enjoying the benefits of their work-from-anywhere lifestyle. It’s a sharply-dressed, attractive crowd with a few business suits in the mix.', 'How does it fit into the neighborhood?\nIt’s in the beating heart of one of Paris’s most dense commercial districts and the only hotel worth considering on the boulevard. In one direction, you’ll find the Galleries Lafayette and Printemps stores, in the other chain restaurants, a handful of indie shops and a multitude of theaters and concert venues. But you’re also a short walk from the Passage des Panoramas, inside which you’ll find a handful of incredible restaurants.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\nIn larger rooms, there was a deliberate decision to keep decorative touches sparse but that means that rustic wooden benches and night tables are left empty. A stack of magazines or a book or two would go a long way to make rooms feel more inviting."", 'Anything we missed?\nThere is no pool or gym.', 'Is it worth it—and why?\nThe Grands Boulevards is a relaxing cocoon of a hotel in an area that rarely falls silent. The metro is right outside but you also have everything within arm’s reach. And if you’re into cocktails, there’s no place better on the boulevard.']","17 Bd Poissonnière, Paris 75002, France",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/paris/hotel-des-grands-boulevards,https://www.grandsboulevardshotel.com/

W Rome,"Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Prepare for a W like you’ve never seen before, located in the heart of Ludovisi—a posh, quiet neighborhood abutting the Villa Borghese and just an arancino’s throw to the Spanish Steps. The brand’s first outpost in Italy captures the exuberant, energetic vibe that W is known for but ditches the dark models-and-bottles aesthetic, opting instead for spaces that look as good by day as they did the night before, while striking the right mix of elevated and playful. Award-winning firm Meyer Davis Studio oversaw the transformation of the property’s two 19th-century palazzi, which now feel thoroughly modern thanks to natural light, pastel palettes, and an alfresco courtyard filled with greenery and fountains. The rooms—some with views onto the neighboring Swiss Institute’s lavish gardens—have gorgeous herringbone wood floors, powder-blue walls with pink and navy furniture, and opulent marble bathrooms. But don’t let the hotel’s refined aesthetic fool you—this is still a place to see and be seen. Up on the rooftop you’ll find a plunge pool (that’s more suited for snapping selfies than swimming laps), as well as Seu Pizza Con Vista, one of Rome’s only rooftop bars. At sunset, it becomes one of the most magical places in the entire Eternal City.","['Why book?\n Style mavens and scene seekers will appreciate this stylish, spirited hotel’s cool décor and attitude', 'Set the scene\n The opening of the W has been the talk of the town since the Marriot first dropped hints it would be bringing its upscale, risk-taking brand to the Eternal City. The pandemic caused a few delays, but now she’s here—drawing a well-traveled, design-savvy crowd who know when they’re onto a good thing: in this case, a lounge room instead of a lobby; and welcome desk pods instead of a check-in, plus a secret garden with tropical foliage where you can have a drink while you wait for your room to be ready.', 'The backstory\n The W hotel brand has always combined elegance and youthful energy, and W Rome keeps that same spirit, set across two 19th-century palazzos along Via Liguria, next to the Spanish steps. The design team (New York’s Meyer Davis Studio) has crafted the lobby and lounge area with panache, daring to take a traditional setting and adding colorful leather furniture against thick stone walls, plus plenty of reflective surfaces that add a reflective glow to the room. There are head-turning sculptures and wall-encompassing art, juxtaposed by black and grey marble flooring. They’ve kept elements of surprise throughout, like the hidden door in the bathroom that leads to the hotel’s secret garden, with a kissing bench, bird baths, and water fountains.', 'The rooms\n The 147 rooms (and 15 suites) are generous in size, giving the feeling of being in your own apartment rather than a hotel. Most have balconies and terraces, but guests are here for the W’s flair of mixing colors and prints: like the red velvet curtains that contrast with the herringbone floors and the pale blue walls. Bed frames are the W’s signature ochre, and there are big graphic prints in bold shades of orange, red, and green. The bathrooms were our favorite feature: marble clad with rain showers and snazzy fuchsia accessories. Rates from $800 per night.', 'Food and drink\n The W’s restaurant scene lasts well into the early hours – even breakfast (fresh pastries, cakes, and chocolates) feels like a party. On-site restaurant Giano offers a contemporary take on Sicilian dishes, but in our opinion, the aperitivo (from 6pm) is even better, with Sicilian street food specialties matched to local cocktails. The live DJ soundtrack and t-shirt clad staff reflect the clientele.', 'The spa\n There’s no spa per se, but the fitness center—Wellness at W Rome—is run by Italian athlete Pietro Boselli and offers everything from boxing to yoga and personalized running routes around the city.', 'The neighborhood/area\n This Roman landmark is a few steps from Piazza di Spagna, a two-minute walk to the people watching and boutique shopping area of Via Condotti, and a 15-minute walk to the Trevi fountain.', 'The service\n The slicked hair, t-shirt wearing, tattooed staff are a tad too cool for school; but once you get their attention, they’re always keen to help.']","26/36, Via Liguria, Rome, Italy",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/rome/w-rome,https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/romwv-w-rome/overview/

Celebrating its 130th anniversary this year, the Hassler is owned and operated by the sixth generation of a Swiss hotel dynasty, and over the years, it has attracted decades of royalty—the real kind (Queen Noor of Jordan), the Hollywood variety (Audrey Hepburn), and both (Grace Kelly). Princess Diana once said that the bar here serves her favorite Bellini, though you’ll also want to try the signature Veruschka, made with pomegranate juice and sparkling Italian wine. For some of the best views of the city, head up to Imàgo, the Michelin-starred restaurant on the sixth floor, from which you can see a who’s who of Ancient, Renaissance, and Baroque architectural treasures.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nThe Hassler Roma describes itself as the ""Stairway to Heaven,"" and, like the song, it’s an icon.

The first-floor Grand Deluxe Suites are particularly lovely, with views down to the Spanish Steps and furniture wrapped in silk. Like all proper suites, there’s a separate living room, which creates a home away from home feel.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe bed is big and roomy, with a very good pillow menu.', ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies.

Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe Amorvero Spa offers facials and massages, and the gym is ideal for working off those carbs. If you ask the concierge nicely, they’ll let you up to the panoramic terrace on the 7th floor, which is particularly spellbinding during the warmer months of April to October.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe concierge desk is packed with old-world charm, with the staff taking real pride in their work. They’ll handwrite you a map, then ask you how your day was when you come back that evening.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"If Rocco Forte’s Hotel de Russie is Anita Ekberg all dressed up in the Trevi Fountain in La Dolce Vita, then Hotel De La Ville is Roman Holiday’s Audrey Hepburn on a Vespa—younger, fresher, and with a bit more pep. Located at the top of the Spanish Steps, it’s a head-to-toe overhaul of the Intercontinental De La Ville, a once-glamorous address that had become increasingly staid. There’s nothing boring about Tommaso Ziffer’s new interiors: Twenty years after his debonair, Art Deco–tinged work on the de Russie, he’s in a playful mood. In the rooms, the walls are hung with convex mirrors and digital reproductions of antique prints, and the colors range from the softest powder blue to mustard yellow and rich plum. The De La Ville’s decorative verve makes up for the fact that very few of the 104 rooms and suites have full-on city views, though book a De La Ville suite if that’s a deal-breaker. But the millennials who are already flocking to this good-looking Roman berth are unlikely to complain. The Silk Road–inspired cocktails at the rooftop bar and the updated traditional Roman dishes at the streetside trattoria help focus the mind on what’s on the inside.","['Set the scene.\n In the 18th century, \nRome\n was full of young, northern aristocrats bent on improving their minds, seeing some ruins, and perhaps flirting a little along the way. Italian architect Tommaso Ziffer has taken this Grand Tour theme for a playful walk in his design scheme in which pompadoured ladies and improving landscapes have been digitally copied onto Napoleonic yellow wallpaper, repro micro-mosaics (popular souvenir purchases back in the day), adorned coffee tables, and nests of convex mirrors add a surreal touch. It all makes for a fresh, unpretentious take on the Roman luxe hotel genre.', 'What’s the backstory?\n Rocco Forte shook up the Rome hotel scene when he opened the suave \nDe Russie\n in 2000. Twenty years on, the Anglo-Italian hotelier has returned to the Italian capital with the same designer in tow, Tommaso Ziffer, to transform a staid five-star, the InterContinental De La Ville, that for years had been running on Dolce Vita fumes. Only the last part of the name remains in Ziffer’s engaging top-to-toe makeover.', 'What can we expect in our room?\n Once beyond the slightly alarming red embossed leather-effect doors, rooms are delightful refuges that play on neoclassical, antiquarian, and archaeological motifs, from the geometric patterns in the plush velvet headboards to fabrics printed with Piranesi’s etchings of Roman pine trees. Don’t count on sweeping views over Roman rooftops, though: only the three glamorous top-floor hideaways Canova, Roma, and De La Ville, plus a handful of other rooms offer those (find the word ""panoramic"" in the room category). Most look onto a quiet inner courtyard or straight and narrow Via Sistina.', 'How about the food and drink?\n All of Rocco Forte’s Italian properties—plus the Hotel Amigo in Brussels—have a single creative director of food, celebrated Roman-born, Tuscan-trained chef Fulvio Pierangelini. In Mosaico, the restaurant situated a little awkwardly at the center of the hotel, Pierangelini pushes the Mediterranean east via the Bosphorus to India and beyond in a menu that mixes up naan bread, \nmanakeesh,\n and burrata. However, we were much more taken by streetside Da Sistina, its décor and food both giving a fresh twist to the traditional Roman trattoria—so, for example, the traditional sheep’s cheese and black-pepper pasta topping known as \ncacio e pepe\n is done with three different peppers, and the addition of Sicilian red prawns.', 'What’s the crowd like?\n The film stars and fashionistas are still likely to gravitate towards the De Russie, the hotel that more than any other has become the must-book address for those invested in Rome’s new Dolce Vita. This younger, more laid-back cousin is for global millennials, moneyed but still value-oriented, who respond to the hotel’s sophisticated but light-hearted spin on Rome’s weight of history.', 'Anything to say about the service?\n Only that they seem to be quite good at building warmth into the professionalism you would expect from a hotel of this level.', 'What’s the neighborhood scene like?\n Unless headed to \nVilla Borghese\n, your default direction will be down the Spanish Steps and into the heart of Rome’s \ncentro storico,\n a shopping and art-gallery zone—a saunter that should take all of three minutes. Make sure to graze and grab a tipple around here, as the restaurants at the top of the Steps are mostly stuck in a Via Veneto time warp.', 'Anything else to add?\n One big draw is the Sicilian-themed basement De La Ville Spa, it’s got five single treatment rooms and one double kitted out for Rasul mud rituals, plus a thermal area with all the usual hot and cold spaces.', 'Anything you’d change?\n We would perhaps have sacrificed one of the large rooftop rooms to create a restaurant with a view—a privilege currently enjoyed only by the lovely but surprisingly small Cielo Bar terrace.', 'Is it worth it?\n For Rome, yes—and it’s also better value than its nearby Rocco Forte cousin, the De Russie, though it lacks the gorgeous garden and the celebrity kudos.']","Via Sistina, 69, Rome, Lazio 00187, Italy",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/rome/hotel-de-la-ville,https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/hotel-de-la-ville/

What’s the crowd like?\nIf you see another traveler at Fendi Private Suites, you'll have won the lottery. There are only seven suites in the hotel, and guests come for the privacy, as well as the facilities. If you do see anybody, they’ll be talking to the concierge to arrange outings like a private viewing in one of the local galleries."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nAfter the hardness of the public spaces, it was something of a surprise to step into Suite No.3 and be hit with so much fabric and softness. We’re talking deep leather couches, rugs and cushioned headboards. There’s room enough to roam, and you could fit another bed in the bathroom – which brings the marble back for a triumphant, if less imposing, encore.', ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nLet’s be clear, everything in Fendi Private Suites is worth stealing – if it weren’t they wouldn't have it in there. Karl Lagerfeld photographs line the walls, the armchairs in the lounge were designed by Fritz Hansen, the sofa comes straight out of the Campana Brothers workshop, and there’s a chandelier by Lindsay Adelman. Whether any of it would fit in your suitcase is entirely another matter."", 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nFendi-branded soap. Fendi-branded linens and robes.

Vilòn Roma,"Gold List, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2019. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",2,"The quiet, confident arrival of the Vilòn gave Rome a boutique hotel to showcase the city’s sharp sophistication, which too often gets lost among its antiquities—or trumped by that of Paris and Milan. In its Adelaide cocktail bar, where large-scale black and white prints pop against maroon walls and golden curtains surely recall the fabulous living rooms of the smart designers along Via di Monserrato, a Gimlet (or three) is a revelation. That is not to say set designer Paolo Bonfini, who exercises his craft with restraint and exquisitely clear vision here, brushed off Rome’s history when transforming this former nunnery into a vibrant 18-room hideaway down a central side street. Rather brilliantly, he found ways to make it feel relevant and not forced, which rarely land so easily in Rome. Rococo-style columns are discreet against mid-century-modern furniture, while the city’s famous monuments are referenced in works by contemporary Florentine photographer Massimo Listri. The result is fresh but mature, and self-assured with no ego; the type of place that is not trying to attract hipsters—as so many now are—but rather the finely tuned 40-year-olds they’ll grow up to be. The Vilòn stylishly captures a vital facet of the direction the city is headed in.","['Set the scene.\nA mansion-turned-boutique-hotel on a blink-and-miss-it cobblestoned street with luscious, light-filled rooms and a lovely private courtyard.

Paolo Bonfini, a set designer for the cinema, could easily have gone over-the-top with details, but has quietly set mid-century-mod and Art Deco elements against original features, such as Rococo-style columns, along with contemporary portraits of the city from Florentine photographer Massimo Listri.', 'What can we expect from our room?\nMahogany floorboards, dark blue curtains, marble bathrooms, and big, big showers.

The elevator starts from the first floor, which means you need to haul everything up at least one flight of stairs.

Hotel Chapter Roma,"Hot List, 2020.",2,"Here’s a city that does traditional in spades, but until recently hadn’t embraced the sort of street-savvy, communal-spaced hotel that New York and London are familiar with. So Chapter feels like a place that fully understands visitors who have come to expect DJs spinning at cocktail hour and street-art tours at concierge. The brains behind it belong to Marco Cilia. After years working with London’s Blakes and cool-kid hotel slinger Grupo Habita—New York’s Americano and the Robey in Chicago—he returned to his home country to launch the first of what he hopes will be a string of social clubs and places to stay throughout Italy. The Chapter is in the Jewish quarter, an area right across from hip Trastevere that for years has felt under-appreciated given its proximity to some of the city’s star attractions, such as Piazza Farnese, the Forum, and MAAXI gallery. Its interiors are edgy in a way that Italians sometimes feel too conservative to embrace, which may be why Cilia turned to break-out South African designer Tristan Duplessis for the graffiti-scrawled lobby bar, quirky bespoke rugs, and pared-back, bare-brick rooms with mid-century inspired minibars, industrial metals, and punchy olive-green beds. Sandwiched between the centuries-old synagogues and café-society restaurants of the neighborhood, Chapter feels remarkably at home, even though walking into it from the discreet cobbled sidestreet feels like stepping into one of Rome’s freshest scenes.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"The crush of over-tourism has risked muting the magic of La Serenissima, but the city’s hotels, many of them palaces and villas during the republic’s glory days, remain a bastion of Venetian romance. At the graceful Aman Venice, in the quieter San Polo district, there is slightly more reserve. With its Murano chandeliers and stellar rabbit cappelletti served in a side garden, the hotel mixes the elegantly spare aesthetic of this revered Asian brand with the cultured taste of the Italian count and princess who own the property. In a city awash with much-loved legends—the Cipriani, the Danieli, the Gritti Palace—it takes something special for a newcomer to turn heads. But Aman, which splashed down here in 2013, as ever, had a trump card: Palazzo Papadopoli. This 16th-century confection is right on the Grand Canal just past the Rialto Bridge—which guests whizz under in the hotel’s glossy Riva to arrive at the palazzo’s jetty flanked by cerulean bricole. The 24 bedrooms have been slotted into many of the palazzo’s original spaces, so they are all unique. But the opulence does not compete with Jean-Michel Gathy’s minimalist B&B Italia furniture.","['Tell us about this place. What sets it apart in Venice?\nIn a city awash with much-loved legends—the \nCipriani\n, the \nDanieli\n, and the \nGritti Palace\n—this relative newcomer wins out for its insider location, intimate size, and proper Italian aristo experience, where palazzo pomp meets understated Aman smarts. And what an entrance: under the Rialto Bridge in a glossy Riva, and up to Palazzo Papadopoli’s private jetty on the Grand Canal.', ""Who's behind the property?\nAman is best known for its ultra-minimal Asian beach hotels. So news it was opening a hotel in Venice in a palazzo was something of a shock to die-hard Aman junkies. But, of course, the group nailed it, partnering up with proper Venetian aristos Gilberto and Bianca Arrivabene (he’s a count; she’s a princess), taking over all the family’s 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli (one of only eight palazzo monumentali in Venice) and pairing the priceless frescos, enormous Murano chandeliers, and opulent silks with trademark minimal design—low-slung B&B Italia works remarkably well against all that gilt. The Arrivabenes still live in the top floors, so you’ll doubtless see them knocking about, giving it all a grand-house guest vibe."", ""Tell us about your room. Did it live up to expectations?\nHuge, muted, chic, but damn it, I missed out on the frescos. There are just 24 bedrooms here, all slotted into the palazzo’s original rooms, so each is unique, some—the best—with all the palazzo flourishes you’d expect and Grand Canal views. Try the Alcova Tiepolo Suite to sleep beneath Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s cherub-filled frescos (like the Clooneys did on their wedding night), with walls lined in dove-grey Rubelli silks. Or the Sansovino Suite, with its standout fireplace by 16th-century architect Jacopo d'Antonio Sansovino."", ""Once we've settled into our room, we're probably a bit hungry. What are the options on site?\nThe slightly out-of-kilter Asia-meets-Italy menu has been ditched for ultra-Italian restaurant Arva—melt-in-the-mouth Fassona beef carpaccio, rabbit cappelletti pasta, and fish stew sourced from the Rialto market. Don’t miss Sunday brunch to feast on lobster Benedict or hazelnut pancakes in the Grand-Canal-side gardens."", ""What's the service like?\nFaultless and seamless, with your-wish-is-our-command insider access, such as after-hours access to the \nDoge’s Palace\n, and aperitivo in the Clock Tower in San Marco."", 'Who are you likely to see here?\nThe very rich and the very famous. Butter-soft suede loafers and Loro Piano cashmere.', 'And how does it fit into the surrounding area?\nTucked away in San Polo (a.k.a. the other side of the Rialto Bridge from tourist-rammed San Marco), this is a very clever choice and barely a sign to know it’s there—but still a hop and a skip from the very thick of it. Venice isn’t short of grand hotels with interesting stories, but for location, intimacy, and sheer stupendousness, this is hard to beat.', 'Are there any other facilities we should take note of?\nIt’s an Aman, so of course there’s a spa with superb holistic therapies—some using Aman’s new natural skincare line—dispensed in the three ancient-beamed treatment rooms.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\nThe prices, dear god—they’re enough to sink the city, but what did you expect?"", ""So given the price, do you think it's worth the investment?\nIf you want the full Italian aristo experience in Venice, this is as close as you can get, while not sacrificing any of the super-smart hotel slick that Aman brings to the party.

Five rooms and suites, personalized service, and great comfort complete the picture."", ""What's the backstory?\n Cima Rosa is the creation of American Brittany Hymore and her Venetian architect husband Daniele Vallot, whose mix of classic furnishings, beautiful shades, and luxurious comforts set the tone of the five-suite B&B."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n There’s so much to love about Cima Rosa’s rooms, from the restful, Venetian colors to the mingling of modern touches with antiques. Go for one of the three Grand Canal–facing rooms, where light glows off the water. Three airy self-catering apartments – two in the Dorsodoro district, one in San Marco – complete the Cima Rosa offer.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n Free wi-fi; good quality.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n Daily continental breakfast takes over a large, low-ceilinged living room where the Grand Canal laps just outside the windows. Everything is simple and fresh; eggs can be scrambled or made into an omelette.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"In a city with such a concentration of luxe hotels, none do it quite like this Grand Canal classic. Though the 15th-century palazzo—now a member of the Luxury Collection—has been open to guests since 1895, a 15-month, $200 million revamp in 2013 ensured that it’s no creaky museum piece. (Most modern extras are cleverly concealed.) But it’s the sheer grace of the place that makes it so appealing. Of course, it’s all inimitably exquisite, with rich Rubelli fabrics and priceless art; but this silky cocoon also manages to be utterly affable. Nothing is too much trouble, from the staff who serve cocktails from the martini trolley to chef Daniele Turco, who creates wonders with castraure—those special Venetian baby artichokes. A restorative facial in the spa? A spin in the Riva Aquariva boat? Full immersion in local food at the culinary school? Only if you can take your eyes off that watery spectacle outside: This is still one of the most beautiful hotels in one of the most beautiful, and most fragile, spots in the world.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\n Hotel Gritti Palace, the grande dame of the city’s hotel scene, with its splendid position facing across the Grand Canal to Salute church, really is the ultimate in traditional luxury: a rich-hued marvel of a place that defines classic \nVenetian\n hospitality. The Rubelli fabrics on walls and furniture positively glow, aided by dazzling Murano chandeliers that take your breath away. The grandeur of the public rooms echoes in suites fit for monarchs—or movie stars."", ""What's the backstory?\n Built in 1475 for Doge Andrea Gritti, this gorgeous palazzo is now part of Marriott’s Luxury Collection. A $50 million tip-to-toe makeover overseen by designer Chuck Chewning of Donghia preserved and enhanced the building's historic features while ushering the facilities into the 21st century."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n From the standard double room to the extraordinarily plush Presidential Suite, with its series of floor-to-ceiling windows opening onto a superlative view over the Grand Canal, there's no room at the Gritti that won’t make you marvel at the attention to detail and sheer opulence. Painted ceilings, antique mirrors and artworks, exclusive Acqua di Parma toiletries: Everything here is pure pampering."", 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n Wi-fi is free and fast.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n With the view from this Grand Canal terrace, you could easily overlook what’s on your plate, but the breakfast buffet—or some great pancakes from the à la carte menu—help to refocus your attention. Chef Daniele Turco plays innovative games with local ingredients and traditions in the Club del Doge restaurant. Or just drop by for a Basil-ica cocktail (gin, lemon juice, elderflower liqueur, orange bitters, and fresh basil) in the Riva bar, arguably the city’s most glamorous spot for aperitivi and nightcaps.', 'And the service?\n Discreet, warm, super-professional, and entirely in keeping with the surroundings.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\n The Gritti is plush but never brash, and its clientele tends to match.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n The heavily trafficked tourist route from the Accademia to Piazza San Marco is just around the corner, but as you glide up to the Gritti’s private jetty in your water taxi and relax on the terrace or in the cool, shady interior, you’d never know. The hotel sits at a seriously chic point on that route, right by a slew of big-name designer boutiques.', 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The spa, in collaboration with Sisley Paris, has single and double spa suites, a hammam, and aromatherapy treatments. At the Gritti Epicurean cooking school, small groups are introduced to the marvels of Venetian culinary traditions in half-day to three-day courses.', 'Bottom line: Worth it?

Reached through a hard-to-find courtyard off the Grand Canal, it’s filled with modern statues that underscore Venice’s remarkable history and fabulous art scene. Once you arrive, you'll feel like you're in your very own (and very private) palazzo. And though it's on the back end of the Grand Canal, it's incredibly hushed—totally different from other lodgings in the area. Fellow guests are well-heeled with exquisite taste, and it's likely not their first time to the city. Such is the insider feel of Venart; so you can rest assured that you've chosen well. Rooms are seriously luxurious, with a 'Casanova's lair' sort of vibe: tactile wallpaper, four-poster beds draped in velvet, modern artwork. The Michelin-starred GLAM restaurant does upscale pastas and salads. Food is note-perfect, but you should only do dinner here one night; go somewhere with more atmosphere for the rest of your time. You can take tea in the garden and cocktails in the salon, too. It's the grandness of the grande dames, with none of the dust.","[""Okay, set us up with an overview.\nI'll start with a head's up: it is \nincredibly\n tough to find.

It's safe to assume it's not their first time in Venice; they knew exactly what they wanted by finding and booking Venart."", ""Tell us about check-in. How was it?\n Very simple. The place is small, and feels more like a grand home with a selection of bedrooms, which means you're never competing with a horde of guests for the attention of the (very attentive, professional) staff. They'll whisk you immediately upstairs to your room, which is unlocked by a heavy, utterly charming skeleton key, of course."", ""Tell us all about your room.\nMind-blowing. Luxurious.

It has the grandness of the grande dames, with none of the dust. Get the Grand Canal suite for views out over the back garden to the waterway."", ""Any other notes you want to make?\nWi-Fi was fast and free. Minibars were well-stocked. Nothing beyond the decor had serious wow factor, but it didn't need to."", ""How about the food, or the room service? Anything worth ordering?\nThe Michelin-starred GLAM restaurant does upscale pastas and salads. The space is small and refined, and not at all a scene the way, say, the Riva bar at Gritti is.

You can take tea in the garden and cocktails in the salon, but there's no bar to sit at, per se."", ""So, bottom line: worth it, and why?\nCompletely worth it.

Since rising off Jumeirah Beach in 1999, the Burj has been the symbol for Dubai as much as the Eiffel Tower is for Paris. And despite fierce competition—the regal One&Only, superchic Bvlgari—this homegrown star is still regarded with a mixture of affection and awe. Arriving here and looking upward can make a head spin: The atrium rises 590 feet, a dancing waterfall flanked by aquariums. And the hotel has found fresh ways to innovate, with Michael Ellis, formerly of the Michelin Guide, heading up the restaurants, and Robuchon disciples bringing French finesse to 27th-floor Al Muntaha. While the pool terrace is a lesson in pared-back luxe, the rest of the show is a Baz Luhrmann-style production, with crystal ceilings, silk wallpaper, and gold-plated iPads. In a land of record-breaking one-upmanship, this place still feels audacious. Doubles from $400. ","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nFrom the sail-inspired architectural design to the views from each of the suites, this hotel is all about show-stopping scenery.', 'Nice.

"Bab Al Shams, A Rare Finds Desert Resort, Dubai","Gold List, 2024. Hot List, 2023.",2,"Bab Al Shams reveals herself slowly, her sandstone exterior—an ode to traditional Emirati forts—half-hidden by spindly date palms and sand dunes. In a city that so often leans into excess, the grande dame of Dubai’s desert resorts works her magic with restraint.","['Why book?', 'For a fun, family-friendly taste of the desert a short drive from the city, you can’t do better than Bab Al Shams. A favorite of \nDubai\n residents and visitors since it first opened in 2004, the resort is back and better than ever after an extensive renovation, with a renewed sense of style and completely new restaurants. Many of the key elements that have drawn loyal guests for years—like desert-edge infinity pools, tall palms, and feature archways—are still here, while those that verged on\xa0\nArabian Nights\n pastiche are consigned to history.', 'You’ll still find camels and belly dancers here—which is really the point of this kind of desert experience—but there’s a subtler approach to it all, with an updated aesthetic that feels much more relevant.', 'Set the scene', 'Once upon a time, driving out to Bab Al Shams felt as if you were heading into the middle of nowhere. These days, Dubai’s city limits have expanded exponentially, and the resort no longer feels quite so remote. But once you leave the urban sprawl behind and catch your first glimpse of a camel from the highway, it’s clear you’re heading somewhere different.', 'On arrival, crenelated fort-like walls and tall wooden entrance gates open onto an oasis-like world of swaying palms, trickling water, and Arabian architecture that plays with light and shadow. Three large swimming pools look out over the desert, flanked by new restaurants and rooftop lounges.', 'The crowd is a mix of couples, families, and groups of friends, both loyal repeat guests and first-time tourists. It also draws bikini-clad influencers who like to pose around the central reflecting pool, but you can’t really blame them—it’s a beauty.', 'The backstory', 'Bab Al Shams opened in 2004, which is practically ancient history in a country that’s only 51 years old, and immediately established itself as a firm fixture of the Dubai lifestyle. Ask any long-term resident and they’ll have a nostalgic tale to tell, of staycations and getaways with visiting family, of camel rides and celebrations at the all-singing, all-dancing\xa0Al Hadheerah dinner show.', 'The reimagined Bab Al Shams is the first property in the\xa0Rare Finds portfolio of destination-focused hotels from Kerzner, the parent company of\xa0One&Only Resorts and\xa0Atlantis. While the resort’s main structures remain largely as they were, walls have been removed, windows knocked through, and all rooms and suites gutted to make everything lighter, brighter, and much more up to date. Dark floors have been replaced by pretty pastel tiles, huge camel statues have given way to a thoughtful curation of contemporary décor pieces, and new focal points added throughout.', 'The rooms', 'The resort is inspired by the traditional architecture of Arabian fortified villages, designed to create shade, deflect the harsh desert sunlight, and keep interiors cool. Rooms are spread over adobe-walled blocks, interspersed by palms and native\xa0\nghaf\n trees, and traversed by winding pathways with water features reminiscent of the region’s ancient\xa0\nfalaj\n\xa0system of irrigation.', 'The 115 rooms and suites have undergone a complete overhaul, becoming lighter, fresher, clutter-free spaces. You’ll still find Arabian design touches, but they are updated to feel more relevant, more relaxed, and far less clichéd. Gone are the heavy traditional textiles, ochre walls, and clunky dark wood furniture, replaced instead by pale color palettes with accents of teal and mustard, exposed beams, and softly lit alcoves. The traditional style of architecture means that windows are on the small side, but most rooms and all suites have a balcony or terrace.', 'Bathrooms have large mirrors reflecting available light to avoid them feeling overly dark and are stocked with refillable PETA-approved amenities scented with Arabian oud. Showers are clad with marble mosaics in shades of sand and lapis lazuli; book a Deluxe Suite and you’ll have a deep-soaking tub.', 'Food and drink', 'With the exception of\xa0Al Hadheerah, all of the restaurants and bars at Bab Al Shams are completely new. At the lobby lounge’s metal-studded, marble-topped bar, mixologists shake up zero-proof cocktails like the Passionstar Martini and Halal Spritz. Sit outside in the courtyard for a stronger version, or head to the adjacent Ya Hala bar with its focus on cigars and spirits. On the edge of the sands, Zala serves Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine throughout the day. The basil hummus will have you going back for seconds, as will the cheese-topped\xa0\nmanakish\n breads, served piping hot from the oven.', 'Over at the Pool Bar, drinks and snacks—falafel popcorn, crispy truffle fries, flatbreads—are served right to your recliner. Still to come, and scheduled to open by the end of April, rooftop Anwā restaurant and lounge will offer modern Asian dishes and sunset views over the desert.', 'But the real excitement happens at Al Hadheerah, a dinner extravaganza that is simply dazzling. Horses gallop through the sands, followed by herds of camels and goats. There’s belly dancing, Arabic singers,\xa0\ndabke\n dancers, a spinning Sufi performance, and a live band. It could very easily cross the line into being cheesy, but somehow it doesn’t. The performances are extraordinary, the talent serious. The food—heaps of grilled meats and seafood, pillowy oven-fresh pita, counters loaded with salads and hot and cold mezze, steaming cauldrons of soups, lamb cooked underground, piles of desserts and Turkish delight served on a spit like a shwarma - is mind-boggling in its variety, and excellent in its quality. You’re as likely to be sitting next to a group of Emirati women as a table of visiting tourists, and it’s practically impossible not to get caught up in the excitement of it all.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Bab Al Shams sits on the edge of the\xa0Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve, the largest unfenced nature reserve in the UAE, spanning 10 percent of Dubai’s total area. Next door is Dubai International Endurance City, not a city as such, but a collection of stables and training facilities for endurance horse racing. A new-ish addition to the neighborhood is the\xa0Al Qudra Cycle Track. Not for the faint-hearted, this 86-kilometer track runs through open desert with no shade, but is hugely popular with the local cycling community on weekends. The resort has rental bikes for those who want to head out for a pedal, as well as guided electric fat-bike tours through the desert.', 'Also in the neighborhood are the\xa0Al Qudra Lakes, artificial waterbodies that provide important habitats for waterfowl and migratory birds. Large flocks of flamingos and Egyptian geese can be spotted on many of the lakes, but serious ornithologists should bring binoculars for sightings of bee-eaters and Indian rollers.', 'The easiest way to get off-road and explore the area is on one of Bab Al Sham’s desert drives in their fleet of smart new Land Rover Discoveries. You’re likely to see endangered Arabian oryxes and sand gazelles as you bounce through the dunes.', 'The service', 'Fresh off the reopening, there’s a palpable sense of excitement and pride among the staff. They’re eager to help, confidently friendly, and genuinely interested in knowing your impressions of their resort.', 'For families', 'Bab Al Shams is practically made for families—although there are plenty of quiet areas for couples not to feel overwhelmed. Aside from the swimming pools, family activities include giant chess, croquet, and cornhole on the lawn, an adventure playground with a kid-sized zipline, guided nature walks, camel and pony rides, falconry, and cultural sessions such as Arabic calligraphy and coffee-making.', 'Eco effort', 'Part of the focus of Bab Al Shams’ renovation was to reuse as many objects as possible from the previous property. And it’s worked to great effect, with repurposed, uplifted, and reupholstered pieces sitting alongside newer elements, yet looking completely fresh. You’ll still find the odd plastic water bottle around, especially on excursions and activities, but they’re being phased out, and the resort is currently designing its own water-bottling plant.', 'Accessibility', 'The resort has two wheelchair-accessible rooms and ramps throughout the property. Elevators are being installed to provide access to the new rooftop terraces and lounges for guests with limited mobility.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'Bab Al Shams’ current top suites are rather modest affairs. For a more lavish, spacious experience, wait for the eight new Desert Chalets that will be opening before the end of this year. Set back from the main property, they will have more space, more privacy, and their own pools. Also on the way is a new wellness center, the Desert Spa, which will house treatment rooms, fitness facilities, and a hammam.']","Sei Al Salam Street, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/dubai/bab-al-shams-desert-resort-and-spa,https://babalshams.com/

ME Dubai,"Hot List, 2021.",2,"In a city of 160,000 hotel rooms, it is increasingly challenging to stand out. But here we have the world’s only hotel designed both inside and out by the late great Dame Zaha Hadid, and with an accolade like that, it had to deliver. The Opus, a gleaming glass structure punctured by an amorphous void that looks like an ice cube melting under the Middle Eastern sun, has sweeping curves and an organic-yet-space-age aesthetic that informs both the structure and a stay in it. The ME by Meliá group brings its artistic bent with a gallery space hosting rotating exhibitions and public areas decorated with vibrant canvases painted on site by Barcelona artist Mr. Dripping. The brand’s Spanish roots are also lightly woven throughout—Natura Bisse toiletries and spa treatments, tapas at Central, and a poolside parrillada producing tantalizing grilled aromas for adjacent restaurant Deseo. But ME doesn’t lean on paying homage to its roots or even that of the Arabian city it’s in—a relief in the U.A.E. where “modern Arabia” tends to be the styling default. Beyond dipping bedrooms in hues of the nearby desert (in the Aura category) and those of the buzzy city at night (in the Vibe rooms), ME plays by its own rules.","[""Why book?\n It's the only hotel in the world designed inside and out by the late, Pritzker-awarded architect Dame Zaha Hadid, so there’s no better way to experience her work than within this immersive work of art. Buzzy and curvaceous, it’s now attracting the city’s jet set."", 'Set the scene:\n Surrounded by the skyscrapers of Business Bay and in the shadow of neighboring Downtown \nDubai\n, this (relative) low-rise stands tall thanks to its boundary-breaking design. ME beats with the thrum of the city’s creative crowd, attracted by the innovative surroundings, music and colorful restaurants and bars, and swish couples who book in for an otherworldly urban escape or a playful evening out. Walking the corridors, you’ll find and more mysterious VIPs with security posted outside their suites than families.', 'The backstory:\n Since Hadid first revealed The Opus tower in 2007, the ME Dubai within it has been one of Dubai’s longest-anticipated openings. The often-delayed, complex property—every curved glass panel of the undulating void is unique—was worth the wait. True to the ME by Meliá brand, there’s a focus on art and curated exhibitions alongside Hadid’s specially designed furniture.', 'The rooms:\n Like stepping onto the bridge of a super-slick spaceship, the monochromatic guest rooms flow around you with curved walls, wavy furnishings, puddles of plush rugs, and a bathroom that verges on trippy. Suites, with their spacious living rooms, are excellent for entertaining, while two distinct styles of standard rooms help set the scene for how relaxed or mischievous you want your stay to be. For a Burj Khalifa view, book a room that looks east.', 'Food and drink:\n Outdoor Deseo is a trendy draw at supper, serving seasonal local fish and Latin American dishes in a tropical space dotted with colorful rugs, lanterns, and brass palm fronds— succulent squid-ink tempura prawns are well matched to the setting. When poolside, it’s difficult to ignore the \nanticuchos\n meats sizzling on the nearby grill; order a skewer of well-flavored wagyu. Sample all manner of gin and tonics at garden-like Botanica, which may have the prettiest ceiling in town. We just hope you like truffle—it’s more a blizzard than a dusting that gets shaved on top of any dish featuring the fungus.', 'The neighborhood:\n You don’t have to go far to expand your dining options, with an outpost of \nLondon’s\n Roka and homegrown The Maine Land Brasserie in The Opus building. Cross the street and stroll along the Dubai Canal’s waterfront promenade, lined with cafés and yachts sailing back from an afternoon on the Persian Gulf. Although you’re relatively close to tourist hotspots such as Burj Khalifa (a few minutes’ drive away or a 20-minute walk), the immediate area is a bit quiet and still being developed, typical for new Dubai neighborhoods.', 'The service:\n Kitted out in comfy Adidas sneakers, the staff—many of whom are from Spain—are easygoing and friendly. Service is personal with touches of personality—like the thoughtful and fun quotes that are written on your bathroom mirror.', 'Eco effort:\n During lower-occupancy seasons, one wing of the hotel will be shut down and its lights kept off.', 'Anything left to mention?\n If you’ve spent the day on your feet (or the evening before toe-tapping to the music of the live DJ, saxophonist, and guitarist in the atrium), make your way to the pool. A dip in the cooling waters will help, but it’s the spa staff who make the rounds in the afternoon offering generous foot massages that really does the trick.']","The Opus by Omniyat, Al Amal Street, Dubai, UAE",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/dubai/me-dubai,https://www.melia.com/en/hotels/united-arab-emirates/dubai/me-dubai/index.htm

So while the developers and current operator Provenance Hotels might have outfitted the building with street-art murals in the foyer, a happening restaurant and lobby, once you get upstairs to the rooms, it’s clear from the smaller room categories (especially from those with shared bathrooms) that this building had a previous life.', 'The rooms\n The decor is a chaotic mashup of utilitarian details, midcentury modern lines, and maximalist art, but it’s a mix that somehow works. At just 130 square feet, the entry-level rooms are definitely on the cozy side: the kind of room where you can wash your hands in a sink, hang up a coat, and step into bed all from the same spot. It’s just enough space for a solo business or leisure traveler, but if you’re traveling in a pair you may want to upgrade to the Studio Suites, or better yet, the newly-added Revolution Lofts, which are located next-door to the main hotel building.

There's an en-suite option too, so you can keep your privacy and keep to your budget."", 'Food and drink\n There’s a coffee bar off the lobby which serves up barista drinks using Abracadabra Coffee beans roasted in Vermont. And the hotel’s attached Cósmica restaurant is one of the best taquerias in the area. Chef Colton Coburn-Wood’s fluke tostada made with habanero and passion fruit is the stuff of legends, and the fried clam tacos with smoked jalapeño aioli are a blend of New England and Mexican cuisines you’re unlikely to find anywhere else. Walk by the hotel on a warm South End night and the outdoor dining space is likely to be packed to the gills with creative types, foodies, and young professionals leaving work.', 'The neighborhood/area\n The Revolution sits at the confluence of Back Bay, the South End, and downtown, in the heart of none of those neighborhoods but a two minute walk to each of them. The hotel offers complimentary bike rentals so you can cruise around and explore.

"Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street, Boston","Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"With the opening of the 61-story One Dalton, Boston joined New York City, San Francisco, Miami, and Beverly Hills as the fifth U.S. city with two Four Seasons hotels (the older property is located a stone's throw away on Boylston Street). In addition to 215 hotel rooms and suites, One Dalton also houses 160 private residences, a spa and pool, and two restaurants: One + One for upscale American food with a New England bent, plus Zuma—the 12th location worldwide for the contemporary izakaya chain, and a destination in itself. Newbury and Boylston streets' ample shopping and dining are within a five-minute walk. And some of the city’s largest cultural destinations—the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, and the Boston Public Library—are also well within walking distance.","['Give us an establishing shot. What will we first notice here?\n The street for which Four Seasons One Dalton is named is only a couple of blocks long and has only a couple of buildings, so you couldn’t miss the brand-new property if you wanted to—even if it weren’t the third-tallest building in \nBoston\n. The glassy skyscraper juts upward from an area that’s persistently under construction—attached residences are still being completed—yet the lobby, with floor-to-ceiling windows, is serene. A mosaic by Duke Riley covers every inch of space behind the mahogany check-in desk; the swirls of browns and tans are meant to evoke the Great Molasses Flood, which ravaged Boston’s North End in 1919. Just around a curved hallway are three colorful displays of books wrapped in African textiles by the British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, each presiding over a cluster of seating.', ""Is there an interesting backstory here?\n The 724-foot-high, 61-story One Dalton was designed by architect Henry Cobb, the architect behind Boston’s seminal John Hancock Tower (now called 200 Clarendon Street). With the property's May 2019 opening, Boston joined New York City, San Francisco, Miami, and Beverly Hills as the fifth city with two Four Seasons (the older Boston Four Seasons is located on Boston's Boylston Street). In addition to 215 hotel rooms and suites designed by Bill Rooney, who also did Boston’s \nLiberty Hotel\n, Four Seasons One Dalton will house 160 private residences."", 'Tell us about your room. What type was it? How did it look, and what was it like to be there?\n Configured as a living room and ensuite bedroom conjoined by a central dressing area, our Executive One Bedroom Suite carried many of the design details found throughout the lobby and public spaces: a neutral palette of grays and browns, mahogany furniture with polished nickel accents, and fabrics that call to mind men’s suiting, from the wallpaper to the carpets. The bathroom, basically a block of marble, featured a freestanding MTI tub, a TV built into the lighted vanity mirror, and a separate shower stall stocked with Maison Margiela toiletries. Solo travelers (or those without modesty hang-ups) can slide open the doors that connect the bathroom to the dressing area and bedroom to create an even larger, flow-through space. The lighting panels were well placed and easy to use, and floor-to-ceiling glass windows offered the full range of Boston highlights: a tree-lined street with tidy brick townhouses, the Italian Renaissance–style dome of the Christian Science church complex, a straight-on shot into the brand-new 30 Dalton apartment building, and, in the distance, the Green Monster of Fenway Park.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-fi – and is the quality good?\n The free Wi-fi works perfectly.', ""What's on for food and drinks here? Would you eat here if you weren't staying here?\n One + One, which does upscale American food with a New England bent, probably isn’t a draw in itself, although one glance at the besuited 8 a.m. crowd and it’s clear the restaurant is already a power-breakfast hot-spot. \nZuma\n, on the other hand—the 12th location worldwide for the contemporary izakaya chain, which was founded in London in 2002—is a real destination. It’s loud and clubby, with women posing for selfies in tight dresses and spiked heels, but the food is great and the service is convivial. The vast menu, which includes sushi and sashimi, various skewers, snacks, tempura, and cooked mains, might feel daunting, but you can’t go wrong with the duo of salmon and tuna tartare (dramatically presented and accompanied by crackers and a metal spatula for DIY spreading) and the miso-marinated cod. And Trifecta, an elegant ground-floor lobby bar specializing in mixology, is a fantastic place for a nightcap."", 'Did anything stand out about the service?\n Staffers are mannerly and buttoned-up; you’ll never hear your first name, even if you insist on being called by it. But perhaps because the hotel is still so new—or perhaps just because it\'s ""Boston,” as several local friends and family members have insisted, referencing the city’s somewhat gruff, blunt culture—service at times felt transactional and a bit ungenerous. Those looking for rarefied, seamless hospitality will certainly be disappointed—if not wholly baffled—to be quoted a $10 “runner’s fee” for emergency toiletries (say, contact lens solution) not kept onsite, or to be told—direct quote—“I’ll have to get back to you” in response to a request that the suite be serviced at a specific time. Our best encounters occurred when staff went off-script, whether it was Angel, one of the bellhops, who tickled our kid to the point of belly-laughs; the whole team of servers at Zuma, which made this somewhat self-conscious solo diner feel welcome and well cared for; or Olivia, in the concierge department, who advance-emailed a floor-by-floor breakdown of the infant- and toddler-friendly spaces at the Boston Children’s Museum.', 'Who are your fellow hotel guests?\n Jet-setting Four Seasons loyalists with Bentley SUVs, Gucci T-shirts, and Louis Vuitton luggage; guys in suits making deals over eggs and fresh-pressed juice; solo business travelers catching some shuteye before their morning meeting around the corner; sexily clad 20-somethings posing for Instagram photos outside Zuma; and wealthy parents taking their high schoolers to visit Harvard and Tufts.', ""What else is in the neighborhood? Is this a place you'd want to hang out?\n The new Four Seasons is in the middle of Back Bay, an enormous tourism hub (and Boston’s convention-center epicenter). It’s directly across the street from a Hilton and Sheraton (and, thankfully, a \nFlour Bakery\n), just around the corner from a Mandarin Oriental, and about a mile from a cluster of ultra-top-tier luxury hotels near Boston Common; specifically, Taj, The Ritz-Carlton, and its sibling Four Season. Newbury and Boylston streets, both within a five-minute walk, have ample shopping and dining. And some of the city’s largest cultural destinations—the \nMuseum of Fine Arts\n, \nBoston Symphony Hall\n, and the \nBoston Public Library\n—are also within reach."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\n The service needs work and the lobby could loosen its tie a bit; much like the lobby in an upscale condo building, it’s a space you would pass through but not necessarily settle into."", 'Anything we missed worthy of a call-out?\n Four Seasons as a brand is famously family-friendly, and here that means various things: kid-size robes (which, along with other extras, you can request via an in-room iPad), baby bath toiletries, an in-room teepee with its own down comforter, books and toys, furniture edged with foam baby-proofing tape, and a Playtex Diaper Genie. The latter two are nearly unheard of, but the cherry on top was our one-year-old son’s name spelled out in letter decals inside the tub. Meanwhile, The Wellness Floor at One Dalton includes a spa with five treatment rooms, each with a name that might otherwise be neon Instagram signage in a trendy juice shop (“Be Here Now,” “Wake Your Dreams”). But no matter; the services (particularly the customizable deep-tissue massage) are great; the products are from ultra-deluxe brands like 111Skin; and a user-friendly iPad check-in allows you to choose among several types of background music, including “Symphony.” On the other side of the floor, past a massive, tiled cherry-blossom mosaic, is a 64-foot-long heated indoor lap pool; the bathroom is thoughtfully stocked with a Suitmate Swimsuit Water Extractor (not to mention excellent Oribe hair products).', 'Bottom line: Worth it?\n Luxury seekers and Four Seasons fans will flock to One Dalton without even questioning it. Half-unpack in one of the large, well-laid-out rooms, kick back with a Suntory whisky Old Fashioned at the city’s dining destination du jour, and nurse the hangover the next day, fresh juice in-hand, at the pool and spa. If you’re looking for a deluxe urban stay and an upscale Boston home base—rather than a fully transportive escape—you won’t be disappointed.']","1 Dalton Street, Boston, Massachusetts, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/boston/four-seasons-hotel-one-dalton-street-boston,https://www.fourseasons.com/onedalton/

Its location at the bustling corner of Newbury and Arlington streets affords prime views of the oldest public park in the country, Boston Common (founded in 1634) from the lush and manicured Public Garden side of the green. Prior to a two-year renovation and its reopening as The Newbury in May 2021, the property was the Taj Boston under different ownership. The 2019-2021 renovation overhauled all of the shared guest spaces, added several rooms and suites, and restored the property’s historic ballrooms. Floors 8 through 16 of the building are residential (you’ll notice the 20s-era elevators forgo those buttons), and the hotel’s rooftop restaurant \nContessa\n occupies the 17th floor.', 'The rooms\n The property’s 286 rooms include a whopping 90 suites, some with wood-burning fireplaces (birch logs provided) and far-flung views of the downtown skyline across the park.

Spring for the Mansion or Corner House suites for high-floor vantage points, massive marble bathrooms with double sinks plus a separate shower and tub, and plenty of space (about 1,500 square feet each). For a smaller splurge, settle into a lower floor Grand Suite, preferably on the park side to feel like you’re nestled among the trees. Arlington Street can be noisy, but suite bedrooms are situated away from the street-side, ensuring you won’t hear a peep at night.', 'Food and drink\n In-the-know Bostonians flock to the Newbury’s rooftop restaurant Contessa, which is currently booking up weeks in advance (save for the first-come-first-serve bar seating) for Northern Italian dishes, aperitivo martinis, and stellar desserts. The 4,000-square-foot restaurant is the first Boston venture by New York–based Major Food Group (of \nCarbone\n and \nSantina\n). Stand-out seasonal menu items include the truffle-dotted beef carpaccio (vegetarians will love the squash carpaccio version), daily imported burrata, hand-made pastas like spicy lobster capellini, and perfectly seared scallops or veal chops. If you can’t get a table, squeeze into the bar for inventive cocktails like a Boston sour (a whiskey and egg white martini topped with lambrusco) or a classic espresso martini. And any visit to the hotel should kick off with a craft cocktail at the ground-level \nStreet Bar\n; belly up at the bar or kick back at a lounge table surrounded by curated art works that will have you turning to inspect the walls and bookcases. A hidden back-room library is even more detailed in its decor (and great for those who want more privacy), flooded with titles ranging from Tennessee Williams to nonfiction about the New England Patriots.', 'The spa\n There’s no spa; Newbury Street boasts a plethora of salon and massage options if you’re seeking one. But the property’s in-bathroom soaking tubs and steam showers, plush Frette linens and robes, and toiletries by Byredo, designed exclusively for the hotel, are relax-in-your-room-worthy.

In summer months the city sporadically closes the thoroughfare to traffic for Open Newbury, making for a welcome change to the perpetually cramped sidewalks. Nearby attractions within a short walk include the Freedom Trail, Massachusetts State House, Boston’s South End, the mansion-lined Commonwealth Avenue Mall, and Beacon Hill’s cobblestoned streets.', 'The service\n Boston-friendly: The staff is knowledgeable and warm without being overly fussy.

The Whitney Hotel,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",0,"At first glance, The Whitney looks like Beacon Hill’s coolest new condo building, thanks to large windows, chic signage, and gleaming new architecture. In reality, it offers a personal and intimate hotel experience. Its location near the Charles River Esplanade will let you eschew the obvious tourist sites and take on the expert perspective of a wealthy local. And the staff's tendency to go out of its way to accommodate families—and their dogs—make a stay here comfortable in every imaginable way.","['Why did this hotel catch your attention?\n At first glance, The Whitney looks like Beacon Hill’s coolest new condo building, thanks to large windows, chic signage, and gleaming new architecture. Inside, past the engineered-marble check-in desks and the floor-to-ceiling glass cabinets filled with books from prominent Massachusetts authors, is a huge mantel framed by several conversation areas (one with retro-inspired vintage trunks standing in for end tables), a brass elevator topped with an old-fashioned clock, and table lamps with built-in electrical outlets. The air feels fresh, cool, and fragrant, especially on the humid summer day when we stepped in, and the expanse of stylish gray paint will have you begging your decorator for an emergency house-call.', 'Is there an interesting backstory here?\n Built in 1909, the building that now houses The Whitney was originally part of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, a specialty hospital, before it became a B&B. Related Beal bought the property in 2016 and shuttered it in 2017 for a large-scale renovation; a 12,000-square-foot addition, attached via a glass connector to the original structure, expanded the capacity from 46 to 65 rooms. Named for the local American industrialist Henry Melville Whitney, who once owned this site, The Whitney owes its historically sensitive new architecture to the Boston-based firm Hacin + Associates, with interiors by Ealain Studio of Maine.', 'Tell us about your room.\n Our Premium King Suite (one of four suites), tucked into a corner in the hotel’s addition, opened into a tidy living room with tufted leather armchairs, nesting coffee tables, mismatched floor lamps, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Around the corner, past a spacious white-tile bath with a graphic, modern vanity strewn with Grown Alchemist toiletries, a huge corner bedroom offered views of the Charles/MGH Red Line platform in one direction and mid-rise brick buildings in the other. A quilted navy headboard and a sofa-like bench bookended the comfortable king-size WRIGHT bed, topped with piped Sferra linens. Much like the hotel’s public spaces, the details felt confident and masculine: a Georg Jensen cocktail kit and Schott Zwiesel Old Fashioned glasses, a woven herringbone throw monogrammed with “WH,” and three 200mL bottles of booze from Boston distillery Bully Boy. Fresh hydrangeas and a watercolor bearing a sailboat-strewn Charles River chimed in with softer touches.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi – and is the quality good?\n The Wi-Fi was free, but it worked well one minute and cut out the next.', 'What does the hotel have for food and drinks?\n At Peregrine, the onsite restaurant from the team behind Juliet (named one of America’s Best New Restaurants in 2016 by Traveler’s sister pub Bon Appetit), a Mediterranean-influenced menu is a safe greatest-hits list of dishes like kale Caesar, Catalonian tomato bread, and roast chicken. The Quick section of the breakfast menu (not included in the room rate) ranges from yogurt and fruit to chickpea toast. There are also several egg dishes (including a zingy lemon-inflected omelet with pecorino and toasted breadcrumbs) and, in the Americano section, some clever riffs on decidedly non-Med favorites, from the B.E.C. (an egg on a croissant with cheddar and bacon) to the L.E.S. (a bagel with all the fixin’s).', 'Did anything strike you about the service?\n The service was excellent and personal, yet still unobtrusive. One of the bellhops quickly learned our son’s name (and greeted him as such every time we came and went), yet no one hovered when we turned the lobby into a de facto play space while waiting for a friend. Advance requests—a mini-fridge full of milk for the baby, a high chair, a crib—went above and beyond. Case in point: “Good Night Boston,” an illustrated baby board book, among the lovely array of tot-friendly amenities.', 'Who are your fellow hotel guests?\n Academics and execs visiting \nHarvard\n and MIT (Cambridge is just across the river), patients (and their families) at Massachusetts General Hospital, and 30- and 40-something locals popping in to ogle the lobby and clink wine glasses at the newest neighborhood hangout.', 'What else will we find in the area?\n The Whitney sits at the foot of Longfellow Bridge (which connects Beacon Hill to Kendall Square) just off the \nCharles River Esplanade\n, a scenic network of biking and pedestrian paths, playgrounds, and picnic-friendly green space. From your window, you’ll see a parade of Bostonians sneaking in their runs before work. Walk a few minutes in the other direction, and you’ll hit a SoulCycle, a Whole Foods, and other chichi brands that comprise daily life in Beacon Hill. This isn’t a hotel-rich neighborhood though; the closest boutique property is \nThe Liberty\n, a former jail with a completely different vibe.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\n A proper ensuite configuration, rather than a bathroom in the living area, would be clutch for parents traveling with children young enough to be contained in cribs. And in our bedroom, the small corner window could stand for a wider covering so it truly functions like a blackout shade."", 'Any other little perks worth calling out?\n The gym is stocked with rowing machine from Hydrow, a Kickstarter-funded line that was developed locally and integrates with live and on-demand classes, Peloton-style. The hotel also offers sailboat and yacht rentals on the Charles, borrowable bikes, and plenty of perks for pups, including treats, dog beds, and even loaned-but-sure-to-be-stole-by-someone monogrammed jackets. If you crave a late-night cookie but don’t feel like putting on shoes, tip-toe to the Whit Pantry (by the elevator on every floor), which is stocked with complimentary Fever Tree drinks, baked goods, fruit, and bags of ice. Finally, one of the nicest little elements of the hotel is the oasis-like courtyard just off the lobby; designed by landscape architect Matthew Cunningham, the space has a fountain, fire pit, and comfy seating.', 'Bottom line: Worth it?\n As the whimsical brass monocles hanging from each guest room door suggest, The Whitney promises a totally new look at one of the oldest cities in the country, and its diminutive size and indie status—no loyalty programs or points rooms here—will appeal to folks looking for intimacy and personality. It’s perfect for anyone who’s been to Boston a few times already, and especially those willing to eschew the obvious tourist sites to take on the expert perspective of a wealthy local.']","170 Charles St, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/the-whitney-hotel,https://www.whitneyhotelboston.com/

Encore Boston Harbor,,2,"As you drive along I-93, curving your way out of the city, the only way you’d miss Encore Boston Harbor is if you were futzing with CarPlay and not paying attention to the massive building looming in the distance—there’s even an official highway sign trumpeting the casino-resort. As you get a little closer you'll notice Encore is a place where flowers miraculously bloom all year in Massachusetts and no surface is untouched by something gold. This is as much casino as it is hotel (it's a sister to the Wynn Las Vegas after all) and it’s not everybody’s idea of chic, but it’s a lavish urban escape, particularly if you live around Boston and are yearning for a break from the norm—and maybe a break from the kids, too.","['What was your first impression?\n As you drive along I-93, curving your way out of the city, the only way you’d miss Encore Boston Harbor is if you were futzing with CarPlay and not paying attention to the massive building looming in the distance—there’s even an official highway sign trumpeting the brand-new casino-resort. If the curved bronze glass looks familiar, that’s because it’s identical to the ritzy \nWynn Las Vegas\n (this is its East Coast sister). Jutting up from a stretch of waterfront that’s sparsely scattered with low-lying buildings and factories, Encore is a 33-acre property where flowers miraculously bloom all year in Massachusetts and no surface is untouched by something gold. Park the car in a multi-lane valet operation (trying not to let the neighboring Mercedes Maybach shake your confidence) and four uniformed bellhops descend, NASCAR-pit-crew style, to sweep your luggage away. Inside, a huge carousel—made entirely of silk flowers and crystals—holds court in a light-drenched central atrium with intricate mosaic floors.', 'Give us a sense of the scope of this place?\n The first thing to know about Encore Boston Harbor is that it’s not coy about its price tag; everything from the press release to its official Instagram handle drops the figure “$2.6 billion” like it ain’t no thing. The big, bold numbers pervade every element of this project: a 210,000-square-foot casino, 15 dining outlets, 671 guest rooms and suites (including a 5,800-square-foot Presidential Villa), 50,000 square feet of event space, a 450-seat buffet restaurant, and a staff that will eventually number 5,500 (including hundreds of graduates from The Greater Boston Gaming Career Center at Cambridge College, which Encore helped develop in order to cultivate an East Coast casino workforce). Even the carousel, designed by Preston Bailey, who did the floral sculptures at Wynn Las Vegas, has astronomical stats: 15,000 pounds, 83,000 flowers, and 11,000 jewels. This is the fourth Wynn Resorts property worldwide (in addition to Vegas and Boston, there are also two in Macau), and fans of the brand will recognize the maximalist, ultra-opulent design aesthetic as the seemingly budget-less work of Wynn’s Roger Thomas.', 'Tell us about the rooms.\n At 1,350 square feet, our Signature Harbor View Suite, one of 63, felt (and probably \nwas\n) larger than most city apartments. The space was awash in creams and whites, from the white-lacquer desk and marble surfaces to the geometric headboard and carpeting. There was lots of gold, lots of mirrors, and several gold-trimmed mirrors. Covered in 507-thread-count sheets, the king-size Wynn Dream Bed was crisp and comfortable. But the suite’s standout feature was the bathroom; even with dual sinks, a deep soaking tub, and a separate shower stall and water closet, the floor space was so large it could have easily fit another king bed. The toiletries, cleverly arranged in a three-drawer white jewelry chest on the counter, were simply amazing, with everything from hairspray and shaving cream to makeup remover and shoe polish. Extra credit goes to the no-fuss lighting panels, a grid of nine, clearly labeled buttons with prompts like “ALL ON,” “DRAPES CLOSE,” and “SHEERS OPEN.” The same commands (as well as room temps) could be controlled via the in-room iPads, as well as via voice commands on an Amazon Echo.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-fi – and is the quality good?\n The Wi-fi is free and works brilliantly.', 'How are the restaurants?\n They vary wildly in formality and culinary bent. You might start with a breakfast of eggs and fruit at the Garden Café on the Mezzanine level, meander down to Bru, on the first floor, for a grab-and-go lunch (kale Caesar, cold brew on tap), and cap the day at Rare, an elegant whitewashed space where an epic pull-apart bread whets the palate for a steak dinner. Or, kick things off with a good, old-fashioned cup of Joe at the onsite Dunkin’ (the quick-service brand was founded in Quincy, Mass., about 15 miles south), continue with an all-you-can-eat lunch at The Buffet, a whimsical fantasy-land just off the casino floor, and finish with veal parmesan at Sinatra, named for Ol’ Blue Eyes (and, like the one in Las Vegas, given permission to use his name by The Frank Sinatra Foundation). Many of the restaurants embrace local influences. At Waterfront, a casual seafood spot, a large list of craft beers spells out the distance to each brewery; Fratelli is the first joint venture from Frank DePasquale and Nick Varano, two titans of the Boston Italian-food scene. Note that some restaurants are in the hotel wing and others can be accessed only through the gaming floor; as a result, the latter are only available to patrons 21 and older. A good compromise is Red 8, which is adjacent to—yet not actually in—the casino; feast on steamed barbecue pork buns and beef chow mein while peering in on the action.', 'Did anything stand out about the service?\n This is a casino, so there are security guards everywhere. But that’s where the similarities to Vegas (notorious for its not-always-great hospitality) ends. The hotel hired largely for personality and charisma—then trained the technical skills later—and it shows. So unless you act like a drunken fool and cause a ruckus on the gaming floor, you’re probably in for jovial and pleasant encounters with staff, from the jocular elevator attendant who befriended our kid, to the landscapers who stopped to say “good morning”—shovels in-hand—as we strolled the grounds. Service at the restaurants was uniformly terrific; a special shoutout goes to Sandra at the Garden Café, who, on our second morning in a row, produced iced coffee and fresh fruit before we even asked for it.', 'Tell us about your fellow hotel guests.\n Unlike Vegas, you won’t see anyone too nutty here, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective. Instead, the crowd is a mixed bag of gray-haired local gaming enthusiasts in Red Sox and Bruins T-shirts; international families in Boston for the first time, either visiting Encore after checking off \nBoston’s key sights\n or touring area universities with their high schoolers; and 20-something couples, drinks in-hand, psyched to have a reason to wear that one Vegas-y outfit without leaving New England. We spotted one Sweet 16 party, and there’s a big after-work scene among locals, as well. On weekends, the casino floor buzzes into the wee hours—thanks, in part, to a law that allows alcohol to be served to active gamers until 4 am (two hours later than normal).', 'What about the neighborhood?\n There’s not much else in Everett, Mass., and Encore is a 10- or 15-minute Uber to most central points in Boston proper. But the resort also runs regular water shuttles to a couple of piers in the city.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\n Warm hospitality aside, this hotel is a bit tough with young kids, which we happened to have. Some restaurants don’t allow little ones under 5, and, again, all of the ones in the casino are all 21-and-over. We didn’t see many and babies and toddlers here, but the demographic that probably has them—couples in their 30s and 40s—seemed excited to have hired babysitters, anyway."", ""Anything we missed?\n A massive spa and wellness floor is just as decadent and intricately designed as the rest of the property, with spa lockers clad in white faux alligator skin and trimmed in gold. Treatments run the gamut, but the HydraFacial, which uses serums and vacuum pressure to moisturize and tone skin and unclog pores, is particularly helpful in counteracting the effects of a drink-dine-repeat casino stay. Should you need, say, a full-length ball gown with sequins and feathers, you’re in luck: The Wynn Collection boutique, which is filled with all sorts of jewel-encrusted Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choos, stands poised to drain your bank account. And finally, it’s lovely to step onto a casino floor and not feel like you're choking; unlike its Vegas counterpart, Encore Boston Harbor is completely smoke-free."", 'Bottom line: Worth it?\n Unless you’re an avid gambler with very deep pockets and very few limits, Encore Boston Harbor is probably about right only for a night or two. The rooms are large, incredibly comfortable, and thoughtfully appointed; the brand’s signature, high-design opulence is apparent in every nook, cranny, trim, cladding, covering, surface, corner, and curve; the spa is an ethereal world unto itself; and there are vast, solid dining options staffed with affable hospitalitarians. It’s not everybody’s idea of chic, but it’s a lavish urban escape, particularly if you live around Boston and are yearning for a break from the norm—and maybe a break from the kids, too.']","1 Broadway, Everett, Massachusetts 02149, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/encore-boston-harbor,https://www.encorebostonharbor.com/

"The Langham, Boston","Hot List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2017. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",2,"In the heart of Boston’s Financial District, this Langham offers as much style as it does comfort. The ground-floor cocktail bar and a cavernous Italian restaurant in the former bank’s grand hall, located off picturesque Post Office Square, have had Bostonians eager to get back in the building for cocktails or a brunch reservation since the property closed in 2019 for a two-year facelift. But the real treasures are in the rooms, where creature comforts like velvet-soft robes and a heavenly bed can make you forget the busy world outside. Book a Chairman Suite for top-floor views and a massive white-marble bathroom. Rooms from $425. —Shannon McMahon","['Why book?', 'For truly opulent yet thoughtful digs in a renovated historic site that offers as much style as it does comfort; think local art in all 312 rooms, not-so-mini bars stocked with Massachusetts-sourced goodies, 18 suites with heated bathroom floors, and chic dining (and imbibing) options that have long attracted locals.', 'Set the scene:', 'In the heart of \nBoston\n’s Financial District, this Langham sees a well-heeled clientele that includes both suited businessmen off-the-street as well as established families, creatives, and couples just passing through town. The ground-floor cocktail bar and a separate cavernous Italian restaurant in the former bank’s grand hall, both located off picturesque Post Office Square, is usually full of Bostonians grateful to be back in the building for a quick drink or brunch reservation—the property reopened in 2021 following a two-year closure for a facelift.', 'The backstory:', 'Originally built in 1922, the building was once Boston’s U.S. Federal Reserve Bank—a fact easily discernible from the landmark-designation plaque outside, and the many Fed crests adorning the property’s original entryways and floors. Langham took over the building in the 1980s after the Federal Reserve moved down the street to a skyscraper, although the bank left behind two towering early-20th-century N.C. Wyeth murals (one of Abraham Lincoln with Solomon Chase, mirroring one of George Washington with Alexander Hamilton) apparently too big to fit in the new building. Known for its service-oriented hospitality, Langham welcomes visitors (guest or non-guest) to pay them a visit. Classic furniture and New England-chic decor throughout the property includes banquette seating, moody art and photography clustered on every wall, dollar-bill-inspired flooring, and banker’s-box drawers adorning the walls of the lobby. Most art on-property (and in every room) was purchased from the Copley Society of Art, the oldest non-profit arts association in the U.S., which supported 350 local artists during the pandemic.', 'The rooms:', 'The real treasures are in the rooms, where creature comforts like velvet-soft robes and a heavenly bed can make you forget the busy world outside. Book a Chairmain Suite for top-floor views and a massive white-marble bathroom complete with heated floors and a steam shower. And don’t mistake the massive minibar for an armoire; it’s stocked with local beers and craft ciders (plus the obligatory French wines) and the Langham’s own special-edition Bully Boy Gin—all available for surprisingly reasonable prices. For even more space, ask about the loft-style suites you can book on the second floor: Their original two-story bank windows make them duplexes complete with a seating area looking out onto the lush green and pergolas of Post Office Square.', 'Food and drink:', 'The Langham’s two on-site dining options have Bostonians buzzing. The Fed, a street-level bar that serves elevated pub fare, raw-bar seafood, and inventive cocktails draws those who work in the area for after-work drinks—and has maintained some regulars from its pre-renovation days. (For something special, ask for the Vault spirits list, offering shots ranging from a slight splurge to $800-dollar pours of limited edition whiskeys.) Build your own seafood tower of all the crudos and local oysters your heart desires, or go for the signature toastie, and don’t miss the malted-whiskey frappe on the dessert menu—a perfect pairing with the grass-fed burger, if you dare.', 'Grana (appropriately meaning ‘cash,’ in Italian slang) is housed in the building’s spectacular former bank hall, a grandiose atrium adorned with French chandeliers, original stone floors, and a three-dimensional Lady Liberty head watching over the dining room. The Italian restaurant is open for breakfast, weekend brunch, and lunch service—if you go, find the original Federal Reserve Bank of Boston seal, adorned with two mermaids and the Fed crest, at the center of the room.', 'The spa:', ""While there's no spa, the bilevel 24-hour fitness center with Peloton bikes, Echelon mirrors, a heated indoor pool, hot tub, and saunas offers a place to unwind."", 'The neighborhood/area:', 'The property is walking distance to the city’s biggest attractions: \nFaneuil Hall\n, the Old State House, the North End, Boston Harbor, and Seaport are all a stone’s throw away. Plus, every T (subway) line intersects here for ultra-easy access to virtually every outer neighborhood. Bustling during the day, the area becomes relatively quiet at night, while still promising walkable access to all the city’s best bars and restaurants.', 'The service:', ""The property’s warm staff spares no time or effort in their assistance: Order in-room breakfast for speedy white-tablecloth service at your door in minutes. Langham is known for its top-tier yet unpretentious service: Boxed waters are doled out on-sight at check-in (on top of the free ones stashed in your room). Don’t hesitate to ask the front desk for anything you may have forgotten to pack; it'll be hand-delivered in no time."", 'For families:', 'Families would have plenty of space in the property’s Family Rooms, and two-bedroom or loft-style suites. The area lends to kids with a nearby Children’s Museum and field-trip-famous offerings like the historic \nFreedom Trail\n.', 'Accessibility:', 'ADA-compliant, with wheelchair-accessible rooms and elevators.']","250 Franklin St., Boston, Massachusetts 02110, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/boston/the-langham-boston,https://www.langhamhotels.com/boston

Step inside, however, and the custom furniture and sleek, modern decor captures all the energy that makes this one of Cambridge's most cherished and exciting neighborhoods.

When you're here, you can't help but feel relaxed and removed from the hustle and bustle just outside the hotel's front doors."", 'What\'s the backstory?\n The building has a long history as an anchor in the landscape of Central Square, whether that was as commercial space in the 1870\'s, townhomes at the turn of the century, or more recently as office spaces. It\'s part of an area known as ""Confectioner\'s Row,"" a stretch of Cambridge formerly home to factories for Necco wafers, Nabisco cookies, Junior Mints and Tootsie Rolls. Today, the building is reborn as a boutique hotel under the management of Hay Creek Hotels and Resorts, known for their smaller properties concentrated in the New England area.', ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n The good news is that every single room has a king bed with plush Simmons 13-inch pillowtops, so you can feel free to stretch out, toss and turn all night long. For real - the beds are amazing. The rooms have a sleek, contemporary feel which is a nice contrast to the building's historic side - and touches like custom banquettes, 55-inch TV's, and Bluetooth alarm clock radios are a nice touch.

We didn't have a single bad bite from this menu, but the Small Plates are where Urso really shines, combining international flavors with New England ingredients: like crispy brussels sprouts with chili-lime glaze, jerk quail with a beautifully fresh jicama slaw, roasted carrot and beet salad with sumac yogurt and cashew dukkah, and a sweet potato borek with brown butter urfa tomato sauce. The flavors are out of this world. It's also worth noting there is an abundance of vegetarian and gluten-free options on the menu. For Spring 2021, the hotel will debut its rooftop Blue Owl terrace, which as one of the only rooftop bars in this part of Cambridge will undoubtedly become an instant hotspot."", ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n The hotel is the neighborhood. It's been a seamless part of Central Square's retail, residential and commercial communities since it the 19th century."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\n I wish the rooftop terrace would have opened before winter. But we already got a bumping new hotel and a fantastic restaurant so maybe it's best not to get too greedy."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n To really make the most of the current pandemic situation, 907 Main is offering a ""micro weddings"" package for ten guests or less. Each celebration comes with a ceremony on the street-level, outdoor patio at The Dial or on the open-air roof deck, as well as a reception in the spacious two-bedroom Penthouse Suite.', ""Bottom line: Why are we booking at 907 Main?\n For the price, and the location and the design, you won't find a better deal in Cambridge.""]","907 Main St, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/cambridge/907-main,https://www.907main.com/

The foundation dates to pre-Revolutionary Boston, when it was the home of Edward Bromfield. Around the turn of the century, it entered a new chapter with the construction of a gilded Beaux Arts cast-iron-and-limestone facade. Since then, the property has been home to the developers of the United States's first subway system, as well as well as the Boston School Committee, which occupied the building from 1923 to 1999, at which point it transitioned into the hotel it is today, credited for beginning Bostonians know and love today."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations.\n The fact that each room comes with a personal fireplace speaks to the level of luxury and coziness here.

(If you miss that undercurrent upon arrival, there’s hallway a photo of a topless woman strumming a guitar to remind you to loosen up a little.) A welcome craft cocktail, muddled to order, greets you at check-in. At the indoor/outdoor poolside venue, Little Palm, the sounds of cocktail shakers and Motown grooves keep toes tapping—whether you’re wearing flip-flops, acrylic heels, or no shoes at all. And when it’s time to wind down, the La Bottega robes, walk-in showers, and airy aesthetics in the rooms have you covered. ","['Why book?\n We all need a little more fun in our lives: less formality, more adventure. The Ryder channels that. There’s synchronicity here, in that the hotel is a top-to-bottom renovation of a 1958 structure, the same year that Jack Kerouac’s novel \nThe Dharma Bums\n came out and lit up the American psyche. Kerouac’s semi-fictional character Japhy Ryder was the inspiration here: that beatnik ideal of finding oneself through travel, bucking stereotypes, shaking things up a bit, relishing the journey. And if you missed that undercurrent at The Ryder, there’s a stairwell photo of a naked woman strumming a guitar to remind you to loosen up a little. The attitude here is welcoming, laid-back, completely unpretentious, but in a clean, bright, and professional setting.', 'Set the scene\n The Ryder flanks Meeting Street, one of \nCharleston’s\n oldest commercial arteries, a block away from shopping hub King Street. Two of Charleston’s finest restaurants, \nF.I.G.\n and \nLenoir\n, are a stone’s throw away, but the hotel’s indoor/outdoor poolside venue, Little Palm, acts as its own tractor-beam. By day, twenty-somethings and stylish creatives soak up the morning sun on poolside daybeds, next to a business exec on her laptop beneath the shade of the oversized Italian-crafted, soft-folding gingham umbrellas. The bar gets lively at night, but not obnoxiously so. The sound of cocktail shakers and Motown grooves keep toes tapping, whether you’re wearing flip-flops, acrylic heels, or no shoes at all.', 'The backstory\n In its former life, this property was the King Charles Inn, dark and dated, in need of serious TLC. A handful of hotel developers and real estate partners stepped in to stage phased renovations, then the pandemic hit. The resulting worldwide hospitality shutdown turned into a “lemons to lemonade” opportunity: a year-long, hyper-focused renovation, rebranding, and design. Cortney Bishop, a well-traveled visionary, drew bits of inspiration from eco-lodges in Central America, \npool scenes\n in Miami, and hotel slippers on the fashion runways of Paris. She has energy, great taste, and a penchant for buying cool things.', 'The rooms\n The Ryder’s 91 rooms are a breathable mix of pale woods, custom-woven rugs, mesh drapery, silky smooth flooring, rounded woodwork (everything’s new, so all the drawers glide, nothing sticks), and striking sconces. The sea-glass-hued penny tile backsplash behind the glowing bathroom mirror brightens any morning. Walk-in glass showers featured Malin + Goetz herb-based shampoos. You can spend your evening out on the town or at the poolside bar, or have a night in, throwing off your shoes, wrapping yourself in The Ryder’s Italian-embroidered Frette robe, and watching Netflix on the flatscreen. (Tech was easy to maneuver, when I couldn’t remember my Netflix password, the system linked my email to an onscreen barcode; it worked like magic). The choicest room in the whole hotel is the Hospitality Suite, a corner 1,045-square-foot pad with a free-standing soaking tub (outdoor palm fronds serve as a natural privacy blind), a gorgeously tiled kitchenette, sociable living room, and balcony directly overlooking the pool.', 'Food and drink\n A welcome craft cocktail, muddled-to-order, greets you at check-in, garnished with an earthy carnation. Little Palm, the indoor-outdoor poolside bar-restaurant, offers tropical cocktails and playful southern bites, simple, fresh, seasonal. Tuna Poke is light and bright, the Fried Chicken Skewers a brilliant invention (with sweet chili and garlic soy), and cilantro chimichurri takes Hangar Steak Frites to another level.', 'The spa\n In the post-COVID world, the spa and the gym and the yoga studio come to you. At The Ryder, you can arrange an in-room spa treatment from one of their local partners with 24-hours notice, or have Peloton bikes delivered to your room. There’s an in-room yoga channel in the planning with mats provided.', 'The neighborhood/area\n This section of Meeting Street is steps from everything but not frenetic. Hop on one of The Ryder’s courtesy bikes to explore the historic peninsula, or set out by foot or bike taxi. You are a few blocks south of the weekend farmer’s market, and five blocks north of the “South of Broad” historic residential district, all very walkable. If you have something more adventurous in mind, there’s kiteboarding and surfing on one of the nearby barrier islands.', 'The service\n From valets to check-in, service is genuinely amiable, and the concierge is ready to advise on what and where next.', 'For families\n It’s not exactly “family driven” but kids are welcome. The pool is fashionable but petite, so rowdy kids aren’t really a fit here.', 'Eco effort\n There are nice touches, especially with material choices—designer Cortney Bishop sourced Happy Habitat recycled cotton blankets; the room tumblers are ceramic (not plastic) by Charleston-born MaryMar Keenan of MMclay design studio in San Francisco.', 'Accessibility\n There are ADA-accessible rooms and corresponding elevators and a state-of-the-art ADA pool lift.', 'Anything left to mention?\n The hotel is laid out like a rectangle with long run hallways. If there’s a drawback, it’s that the interior rooms, rather than overlooking a landscaped courtyard, instead overlook a sunken car park. I guess that’s staying true to the 1960 motor inn spirit. The retro, sunny mural helps but you might want to request an outward facing room.']","237 Meeting St., Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/the-ryder-hotel,https://www.theryderhotel.com 
86 Cannon Historic Inn,,2,"It’s challenging to strike a balance between design-forward and authentically historic, but 86 Cannon nails it. Designer Betsy Berry worked on the D.C. St. Regis and The Connaught in London before relocating to Charleston with her chef husband. Her work is bold and beautiful, from indigo-dyed grasscloth walls in the parlor, to pomegranate-silk pitched walls in the attic library, with Venetian plasterwork and hand-stenciling by local painter Suzanne Allen. 86 Cannon’s location in the center of a foodie hub absolves the inn of not having an onsite restaurant. In late afternoon, the inn provides a wine and a cheeseboard sourced locally from Church Street shop Goat.Sheep.Cow. There are seven rooms total, so service is beyond attentive.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\n If you weren’t specifically looking for it, you might think this was just another lovely home on a tree-lined cross-street in downtown Charleston. Perhaps soon, owners Marion and Lori Hawkins will decide to hang a discreet sign out front, but since opening in 2017, buzz has been word-of-mouth. Look past the blooming crepe myrtles for the brass 86 above the door of this classic “Charleston single” with double piazzas. If you’ve come by car, drive through the wrought-iron gates at left, down the tropically landscaped driveway (the Lowcountry version of a red carpet), to park in the ample gravel lot out back. Canine residents Gus and Sully bark their greetings from the detached kitchen house the Hawkins call home. When I arrived, the inn’s manager Elliott Wright came out to greet me, having anticipated my arrival via the inn’s interactive text-messaging system. He led me to the front parlor for a quick, personable check-in amidst live orchids and the scent of Casablanca lilies drifting down the stairwell."", ""What's the backstory?\n The main house was built in 1862 and has passed through a handful of owners, from a Confederate officer to the family of a famed civil rights activist. When the Hawkins scooped it up, it was in bad need of repair. Their top-to-bottom restoration preserved authentic architectural details like slate roofing, hardwood floors buffed smooth, window frames stripped of centuries of paint. The couple soon acquired an 1880s “dogtrot cottage” next door, with a long central hallway branching into living quarters. Designer Betsy Berry worked on the \nD.C. St. Regis\n and \nThe Connaught in London\n before relocating to Charleston with her chef husband. Her work is bold and beautiful, from indigo-dyed grasscloth walls in the parlor, to pomegranate-silk pitched walls in the attic library, with Venetian plasterwork and hand-stenciling by local painter Suzanne Allen. It’s challenging to strike a balance between design-forward and authentically historic, but 86 Cannon nailed it."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n  My suite in the “Garden Cottage” backed up to an expansive brick courtyard with trickling fountain, beautifully lit up at night. I had one-half of the cottage entirely to myself. An old brick double fireplace separated sitting room from bedroom, plus a large modern bathroom. Despite fronting the street, the house’s modern insulation kept the noise out. I could barely hear a scooter whizzing by. Exposed joist beams ran the length of the apartment, with ghostly markings of former lathe-&-plaster. Heart pine floors were spotless, with deliberately preserved scorched floorboards by the fireplace. On the king-size bed, starched and pressed Italian Frette linens. Kitchenette included multiple bottles of wine and champagne (for a price), complimentary Nespresso machine, and fridge stocked with Spindrift fruit-infused sparkling water.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n Wi-fi was free and strong.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n 86 Cannon’s location in the center of a foodie hub absolves the inn of not having an onsite restaurant. I counted fifteen restaurants within easy walking distance. In late afternoon, the inn provides a wine and a cheeseboard sourced locally from Church Street shop \nGoat.Sheep.Cow\n with a heavenly lineup of (you guessed it) goat, sheep, and cow cheeses paired with crisp baguette rounds, toasted pecans, and plump dried fruits. Guests choose from robust European continental breakfast offerings, including pastries from Brown’s Court, quiche from Baba’s down the street, and whipped yogurt and gluten-free granola that Lori makes herself, all served with antique silver utensils. I took my tray to the porch to spy on locals walking their dogs and biking to work. It really is a true Charleston neighborhood experience.', 'And the service?\n The inn’s texting system allowed me to converse with the inn’s manager throughout my stay as easily as texting a friend. There are seven rooms total, so service is attentive. If you want a day at the beach, a stylish bag materializes with Turkish towels. To explore historic downtown, choose from the onsite fleet of slim Linus bicycles with leather seats and leather handles. The innkeepers offer great bike route advice to steer you clear of heavily trafficked streets (no bike lanes in Charleston).', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\n Inn guests hail from all over: New York, Texas, other countries, and locals wanting a luxury vacation from parenthood. Even when the inn is fully booked, you can find a quiet spot on the verandas, garden patio, or my favorite, the cozy attic library with its fully stocked honor bar and growing book collection.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n Cannon Street is mostly residential, but you’ll want to pop into a few of its boutique shops: Mac & Murphy for custom cards and stationary; Sugar Bakeshop for cupcakes in flavors you never imagined; and stylish men’s store Indigo & Cotton.', 'Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\n Truly a pampered spot to call home. Worth every cent.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Since The Dewberry opened its doors in the fall of 2016, the fig ivy at its base has diligently advanced upward, clinging tightly to the ground-floor columns. Now the hotel appears to float on a garden. Which is just as founders John and Jaimie Brown Dewberry intended, bringing an unexpected lightness to the limewashed eight-story midcentury monolith. You'll love its JFK–era cool factor: Across the giant slabs of buffed marble, past the warm cherrywood paneling with unlacquered brass inlay, waits the popular Living Room, where guests can sink into a cozy leather high-back. Locals duck into the hushed spa for Natura Bissé facials and fill the outdoor patio for weekend brunch. But the largest draw will always be the rooftop for sunset cocktails, nibbles, and maritime breezes among the citrus and olive trees, with views of Charleston’s harbor. The vibe is elevated and elegant but also fun and not too fussy. In one of America’s most historic cities, The Dewberry manages to pay homage to the past while feeling refreshingly au courant. ","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nBy Charleston standards, the eight-story Dewberry towers over \nMarion Square\n with 200 west-facing windows. Its cool, lime-washed facade gives way to a sleek, marble-slabbed lobby flanked by warm wooden walls and accented with mid-century modern furniture. Veer left, and you're in the expansive Living Room, a space frequented by guests and locals alike, where leather wing backs and low-slung cane chairs double as reading and meeting nooks by day, then transition into happy hour haunts by night."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nDiscerning travelers, hipsters, trendsetters, and connoisseurs who appreciate the hotel’s fleet of luxury Volvo house cars.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nMy ""Charleston Flat"" commanded wraparound corner views of a church steeple to the south, and skyline sunset views to the west. Extraordinarily tall windows date to when JFK originally commissioned this building, providing vertical frames of city views. Lofty drapery and gauzy blinds lend privacy. The canopy bed itself is feather soft with Irish linens—it\'s no wonder staff nicknamed it ""the cloud."" The bathroom feels regal, lined with polished Vermont marble and brass fixtures. A deep cast-iron soaking tub with a window view shares a platform with the glassed-in shower. Custom toiletries are on point: a unisex fragrance blend of cedar, palmarosa, and a touch of rosemary.', ""How about the little details? Any of that worth a mention?\nI helped myself to a spicy Blenheim ginger ale ($4) with a pour of Maker's Mark ($35) and a bag of local Callie's cheese crisps ($10) from the mini-bar, then settled onto the soft velvet couch with a leather-bound book from the shelf. I seriously coveted the armoire flanked with indigenous Lowcountry flowers hand-painted by a local artist and printed on soft linen panels. I also ordered extra toiletries to take home for that sensory olfactory extended-vacation experience every time I lather up."", 'Food and drink: What do they have here?\nThe James Beard-nominated ground floor brass bar serves the classiest Negroni in town, with seats that spill out onto an open terrace. You can accompany that with trout-roe-topped deviled eggs, signature burger, steak frites, or other goodies. By daybreak, you’ll want to order up cheddar biscuits and a perfectly folded omelette oozing cave-aged gruyere. And don’t miss sunset from the stylish rooftop cocktail lounge, Citrus Club, with 360 degree views over the peninsula, plus warm blue crab dip, fish fritters in mango sauce, and crispy piña colada shrimp.', 'Anything we forgot to ask about?\nThe Spa is softly lit, cypress lined, curtain draped—truly a destination spa with thoughtful touches like aromatic neck pillows and custom tea blends. From Natura Bissé facials, to hot river stone massages, to detoxifying seaweed wraps, time truly stops within these walls. Oh, and in good weather, rooftop yoga is a serious perk. There’s nothing like Shavasana at steeple height.', 'Bottom line: Why will we love it here?\nOwner and creator John Dewberry continues to preside over every detail of his namesake flagship, so you can rest assured your experience will live up to his exacting standards.']","334 Meeting St, Charleston, South Carolina 29403, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/the-dewberry,https://www.thedewberrycharleston.com/

Conceived as an ever-evolving, progressive “art hotel” with a full-time docent and rotating exhibits, The Vendue is never static. In the past, for instance, the theme has been “red and white,” which translated to a giant red gorilla at the end of a gleaming white hallway packed with provocative paintings, arresting sculptures, and wall hangings. We can’t tell you what to expect when you arrive, because change and evolution is the point. The entire hotel is a conversation starter. Think of a tea party attended by Andy Warhol, Alice in Wonderland, and Louis XIV.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nA row of historic warehouses dating to 1780 were combined into this sprawling boutique hotel, with each facade true to its original historic color, so you experience a ""rainbow row"" effect before walking into the ultra-mod lobby. There is no check-in desk. No need for one. The Vendue has flipped that tradition on its head. Instead, you can either check in remotely, with a mobile key option, and head straight to your room, or you can just show up to be greeted and ushered over to Mad Hatter-style seating beneath over-the-top chandeliers for a fluid, fun check-in process—seated, relaxed, conversational. Across the street, there\'s an extension of the hotel, likewise a living gallery with a resident artist at work in an open studio.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nThis place is not for traditionalists or the faint of heart, but creatives and adventurers will love its wild nooks and surprises (like French inscriptions written on your bathroom mirror, or a bowtied fox watching you brush your teeth).', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nYou could stay at The Vendue 84 consecutive times, experience the 84 different rooms, and be surprised every time. Each one has a different size and layout due to the antique bones and meandering passageways of the building itself: some have fireplaces, some have exposed brick. Little frivolities abound, like French bulldog doorknockers, and gilded “hands” as curtain pulls. In keeping with the current red-&-white theme, you’ve got ruby red showerheads against pristine white tile, so even bathing is an artistic foray. Lather up with ROAM products, a blend of aloe, prairie wheat, and grape extracts, then dive into very comfortable beds. The hotel has swapped out its period antiques for modern.', 'How about the little details, any of that worth a mention?\nThere’s a white player piano in the lobby with plexiglass legs (very Elton John) programmed with a library of thousands of songs. It can even cue a back-up of drums, sax, and guitar.', 'Food and drink: What do we have here?\nCuisine at Revival incorporates authentically local and historical ingredients like resurrected Jimmy Red Corn grits and Nostrale rice, once thought extinct. Another food option is to take the elevator up to the rooftop bar for loaded tots, salads, dips, tacos, and key lime pie. The hotel also offers evening cookies and milk to ease your slumber.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nBoldly unorthodox: a daring and whimsical avant-garde art hotel in one of Charleston’s oldest buildings.']","19 Vendue Range, Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/the-vendue,http://thevendue.com/

Perhaps I would grab a reproduction Sacred Bird and Butterfly Chinese porcelain plate off a hallway wall, a pattern used in Charleston\'s Nathanial Russell House circa 1808.', ""Room service: Worth it?\nNot surprisingly, the most popular room service request is a bottle of champagne and a slice of the hotel's famous 12-layer coconut cake (some people even order the cake for breakfast!).

Dim globe lighting, low ceilings, potted plants, leather chairs you won’t want to get out of, all opening onto a wide open inner courtyard with blazing fire and trellised jasmine. Chef Tim Morton designed his menu around a central wood-fired oven, so blistered pizzas are a main draw. We went for crispy-creamy blue crab fritters, local wreckfish, and a truly addictive side dish of charred corn, feta, chilis, and shredded mint. You can also dine across the street at Hank’s, one of Charleston’s revered upscale seafood venues. For breakfast, Emeline boasts its own sunny café, featuring local roaster Second State Coffee, with excellent pastries.', 'And the service?\n If I could single out any staff to sing her praises, it would be pastry chef Lizzy Skelton, or “Chef Lizzy” as people say when they rave about her housemade truffles and macaroons.', 'What about the neighborhood?

Despite this being a heavily touristed area, Emeline feels private, particularly the higher floors and the “masonette” bi-level townhouse-style rooms opening onto the inner courtyard. You’ve got countless restaurants within walking distance, including award-winners Peninsula Grill, F.I.G. and Husk. You can catch a horse carriage literally out the front door, or hop on one of the hotel’s beach cruisers to pedal around town.', 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The hotel is full of little surprises, so take your time to explore it. Check out the circular iron staircase leading to a mezzanine balcony overlooking the entry. The lobby-level “Keep Shop” brims with well-curated local collectibles, some of them tailored specifically for Emeline, like the hand-stitched leather tote in signature Emeline green by J. Stark. Check out the hallway between kitchen and bar, with lots of artistic eye candy including a deconstructed skateboard wall-hanging. Pause at the kitchen viewing window to watch cooks hand-pulling mozzarella.

Hidden behind a row of diminutive and colorful 19th-century storefronts lurks the Holy City’s largest hotel: a behemoth at 434 rooms, with upper floors deliberately set back to render them invisible from street view, preserving the intimate scale of the city. At ground level, good-natured jacketed greeters swing open double glass doors to usher you into gleaming marble hallways lined with high-end boutiques and galleries, culminating in a grand central lobby. Locals know it well: They lounge here after church on weekends, listening to live music before heading in to the Palmetto Café for its stupendous brunch spread; or they gussy up for special occasion dinners at the hotel’s award-winning Charleston Grill. Over the decades, the hotel has cemented an excellent reputation, first as an Orient Express property and then part of the Belmond collection, but it now boasts the distinction of being locally owned. Charleston resident Ben Navarro, the billionaire and visionary behind Beemok Hospitality Collection, made headlines in late 2021 when he purchased the property and launched a no-expenses-spared restoration and rejuvenation of what was already a beloved Charleston icon.

It’s hard to imagine improving this hotel, but I’m excited to see th vision unfold.', 'How about the little details, any of that worth a mention?\nThings I loved: adjustable reading lamps attached to bed posts; remote control of room lighting; convenient USB charging outlets. Design-wise, I loved the subtle wallpaper at each landing reproduced from a 19th-century map of Charleston. The revamped ground level boutique stocks lots of interesting local keepsakes (definitely not your typical hotel chotskies). And I stumbled on a pop-up ping-pong challenge in the hotel’s lush internal courtyard.', ""Food and drink: What's the story here?\nThe place is home to some of the best restaurants in the city, Palmetto Café and live-jazz-playing \nCharleston Grill\n with advanced sommeliers, smoothly choreographed French-style service, and not a drop of stuffiness. There's also tapas at the Thoroughbred Club just off the lobby, plus a sports bar called Meeting at Market with excellent charcuterie boards, local brews, fish & chips, and wrap-around windows fronting the historic market (position A for people watching). If room service is your thing, all guest rooms enjoy room-service access to both Palmetto and Charleston Grill. I recommend the Palmetto's crab salad (in-room $40), a tower of jumbo lump crab meat, whipped avocado, and zingy golden tomato vinaigrette, topped with shatteringly thin shards of multigrain cracker (in my opinion, enough crab for two hungry people)."", ""Anything else we should have asked about?\nAt Charleston Place, the answer is always yes. If you need childcare, they have sitters on call. Need someone to watch your pup? They've got that, too. The hotel has arguably the best pool in the city, rain or shine, thanks to its retractable glass roof and a steaming jacuzzi tucked within the clock tower. This is a family-friendly hotel, so if the echoes of joyful kids in the pool gets to be too much, just head outside to the V-shaped deck, grab a lounge chair and a cool drink from the self-misted bar on deck. A major highlight is the spa, light and soothing, with ten treatment rooms, two couple treatment rooms, all-natural Tata Harper skin products, and Butter London polish."", 'The gym is large and full of state-of-art equipment. Chilled towels and complimentary headphones are a plus.

Hotel Bennett,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Charleston keeps its buildings low and its historic church steeples high, which meant that owner Michael Bennett had to fight all the way to the State Supreme Court for permission to build his lofty, nine-story hotel.

Smart guests park themselves up here, settling into cushioned wicker with a craft cocktail to watch snowy egrets migrate in the setting sun.

The Pinch,"Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"When the iconic Bob Ellis Shoes shuttered its doors after 66 years at the corner of King and George streets, Randall Cook and David Grasso took note. On multiple visits, the co-founder and CEO of the Philadelphia–based hospitality group Method Co. had fallen in love with the Holy City’s rich history, culinary prowess, and creative industry. So the team purchased five adjoining lots and set about preserving, restoring, and transforming the enclave of buildings into a stylish, warmly contemporary boutique hotel, with active storefronts below and two floors above containing 25 chic rooms, suites, and residences, each with a designer kitchen. The transition has been so smooth, many locals didn’t notice the change until realizing the upper windows were no longer boarded up, then spying the Pinch’s understated marquee. Though the launch has been quiet, buzz has been growing about the hotel’s ground-floor restaurant, The Quinte, a sexy, glowing, darkly paneled oyster bar fronting George Street. Heads will also turn when restaurant Lowland opens in an adjacent historic dwelling, with a tavern, a second-floor dining room with a hand-painted mural and wood-burning fireplace, and a much-anticipated private extended-stay residence on the top floor.","['Why book?\n Centrally located, chic, clever, stylish—a great addition to the city.', 'Set the scene:\n The Pinch sits on \nKing Street\n’s popular north-south artery of clothing shops, wine bars, palm trees, and decorative facades. The steady hum of activity hits a particularly resonant pitch on the Second Sunday of each month when the street closes to vehicular traffic and becomes a European-style pedestrian mall with outdoor eateries and prancing pets on leash. The hotel’s understated marquee anchors the corner of King and George, but the private entrance is tucked discretely off-street. Just follow the flickering lanterns to a cobblestone-laid courtyard where the valet will greet you.', 'The backstory:\n This is a passion project more than four years in the making. Philadelphia-based hospitality visionaries Randall Cook and David Grasso fell in love with Charleston and quietly purchased a cluster of historic structures on King. They meticulously restored exterior facades while unifying interiors into a seamless flow of indoor and outdoor spaces, with guest rooms above. Locals still associate this corner with the decades-old landmark Bob Ellis shoe shop (the go-to spot for Manolo Blahniks, Jimmy Choos, and Louboutins). But a century ago, this was a billiards hub named The Quinte, where World War I enlisted men let off steam and braced for deployment. To honor those roots, The Pinch named its on-site oyster bar The Quinte, a wildly popular little nook with oak-framed double doors connecting to the lobby.', 'The rooms:\n Choose from 25 rooms, lofts, suites, plus a few longer-term residences. The larger suites are perfect for families or groups of friends traveling together who want to lounge in the living room and cook in the generously sized kitchen, equipped with a smooth walnut island, Mauviel copper cookware, and a craft cocktail recipe book for the bar. Even the smallest rooms don’t disappoint, because no matter the layout, every single room boasts design finesse: handcrafted furniture, artistic lighting (bunched linen pendant shades), pinched stoneware in the kitchen, wood-fired ceramics, hand-painted accent wallpaper, potted cacti on windowsills, one-of-a-kind antique woven rugs. The Pinch is a design collaboration between CEO/co-founder Cook and his orbit of trusted talents, like Morris Adjmi Architects and architect Aaron Poritz, and an ensemble of international artists whom Cook knows personally. I found myself coveting a number of items in the kitchen and taking notes on items to purchase for my own dream home: the sleek copper Dualit toaster hand-assembled in England, or the razor-sharp Misen knife set with its smooth blue grip. Rates from $505 per night.', 'Food and drink:\n Top notch. For lunch and dinner, go no further than The Quinte downstairs. Helmed by Colombian-born chef Nicolas Quintero, this cozy 40-seat oyster bar is rightfully one of Charleston’s current “it” spots. I went for dinner and experienced a cocktail epiphany that had me Googling how to make a grapefruit-peel cordial. Many diners choose the seafood tower, with cracked oyster claws and yuzu (Japanese citrus) dijonnaise, creative mignonettes, and hot sauce “droppers” for the oysters. That’s all good, but the individual dishes rival anything in the city. “Chef Nico” sharpened his knives in San Francisco and Chicago before settling here, and he brings a very sophisticated, inspired, nuanced, balanced palate to the city, using local ingredients like micro-wasabi-arugula, popped sorghum, and straight-from-the-boat triggerfish. My favorites: The tuna & beef sashimi over dry-aged tartare in a creamy tonnato sauce dotted with grassy EVOO; and the “Catch of the Day,” kombu-steamed golden tilefish ladled with a fried caper brown butter sauce to die for. Soon, the hotel will open an additional restaurant called Lowland in the adjacent historic house that is part of the hotel’s complex.', ""In the rooms individual brass cocktail kits, well-curated minibar labels (don't miss the canned Unspiked mocktail, with blood orange and cardamom), oversized ice cubes in the freezer, excellent salty snacks, and small-batch spirits. You can ask the hotel to stock your kitchen to order before your arrival, so technically, you’d never need to dine out, but then you’d miss out on Charleston’s culinary scene. For breakfast, you can grind and brew coffee in-room or head to the lobby for fruit, yogurt, and pastries."", 'The spa:\n The single-room spa hides in the building’s center, buffered by silken clay walls, so it’s very tranquil. Make an appointment for individualized treatments, from deep tissue massages to facials using the homegrown botanicals and clean, eco-conscious skincare line from Davines Village in Parma, Italy.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n You’re in the heart of activity. Walk west into quaint neighborhoods and the timeless “cistern” quad of the College of Charleston (founded 1770). One block north is Marion Square and the weekend farmer’s market for all sorts of nibbles and souvenirs. Gourmet market Caviar & Bananas is half a block away. Shop for clothing, books, antiques, and jewelry (Croghan’s is amazing) up and down King Street. Many of Charleston’s top restaurants are nearby (like Lenoir, FIG, and Le Farfalle).', 'The service:\n Service is top-notch and personal: seasoned professionals lured away from other luxury brands, so the hotel has clearly staffed itself well.', 'For families:\n All these gorgeous design touches might be lost on families with young children, so I would recommend The Pinch for working travelers, shoppers, couples, and groups of friends. The hotel is not pet-friendly, but I can’t blame them for not wanting to scratch up the handsome herringbone flooring.', 'Eco effort:\n Sustainably sourced spa products, custom-designed refillable water carafes: The Pinch is clearly cognizant of its eco-imprint. Plus the fact that all of the buildings making up The Pinch’s enclave (with the exception of one new structure) are themselves “recycled” preservation victories.', 'Accessibility:\n There is one ADA accessible King bedroom in the hotel, so be sure to request it specifically if you need ample doorways, handy grab bars, and roomy desks. This is a brand new hotel, built to code, so hallways and elevators are not a problem.', 'Anything else?\n I wish I could kidnap The Pinch’s design team and have them redo my house with their clever mix of tactile pieces: hand-painted black-&-white floor tiles in the bathrooms, beveled glass shower doors (for privacy), perfectly honed sink basins, alabaster sconces, craftsman furniture. I love it all.']","36 George Street, Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/the-pinch,https://www.thepinch.com/

The boutique 50-room hotel looks and feels stylishly contemporary, but walk half a block south, and you’re squarely in the 18th century on an uneven brick alley lined with camellias and flowering peppermint peach. You don’t have to be a history buff to appreciate the fact that you’re steps away from colonial, antebellum, and Victorian architecture, but at The Loutrel, you can retreat to the creature comforts of the 21st century.', 'Set the scene', 'As its name suggests, The Loutrel draws inspiration from (and pays tribute to) landscaping legend Loutrel Briggs, who designed roughly 100 private gardens in and around Charleston beginning in the 1920s. As such, the hotel aims to bring the outside in with plenty of natural light and subtropical greenery. Calamondin orange topiaries flank the lobby, delicate cherry blossom branches spike the floral arrangements, and living orchids accent every room. The lobby itself channels an open veranda (a nod to Charleston’s plethora of breeze-catching porches), with gauzy drapes, silent ceiling fans, and even a hanging swing. Settle into cushioned woven furniture with your effervescent “welcome cocktail” and peruse any number of botanically-inspired, Charleston-themed coffee table books.', 'The crowd', 'On my visit, I didn’t spy any young children (though I’m sure they’re welcome), but rather a varied group of adults of all ages: some Texas businessmen touring local ports, a solo doctor in scrubs heading for rotation in an area hospital, a married couple from Vermont here to explore museums and gardens, a multi-generational family on reunion, a jovial group of young ladies here to hit the town’s cocktail scene. It’s a relaxed but upscale environment; friendly, and not at all pretentious.', 'The backstory', 'The Loutrel is a flagship venture by a group of investors (some local, some not) who made the wise decision of hiring revered local architect Michael Graves and his interior design team. Four stories is the height limit in this section of town, so as not to dwarf the historic skyline. Graves created an elevated ground floor, flooding the lobby with morning sun that showcases an ethereal landscape mural by local painter Linda Fantuzzo. By night, the same space glows with suspended votive fixtures illuminating an entirely different cocktail vibe. Design-wise, colors are subtle, not loud: soft blues and shimmering grays with little pops of iridescence, like the pearled penny-tile wraparound of the bar, or the slight sheen of a carpet, just enough to keep things vibrant but not too flashy.', 'The rooms', 'Rooms are crisp, minimal, and spacious, with floor-to-ceiling windows and double-paneled privacy sheers. I ordered a charcuterie board (curated by gourmet cheese shop Goat Sheep Cow), then sank into cloudlike pillows and angled my large flatscreen TV into perfect view (it’s wall-mounted and adjustable, with a remote that lights up in the dark for klutzes like me). I loved the marble fish-scale tiled floor in the glass-door shower, and rosemary-mint bath products by local makers Paul and Peggy Lieber of “Deep Steep,” who blend plant-derived nourishing soaps and lotions on nearby Johns Island. The minibar was filled with complimentary sodas and snacks, including some very addictive spicy pimento cheese small-batch kettle chips, and lemon sugar cookies by Grey Ghost bakery. My room did not have a spectacular view, which was fine because I drew the shades, tucked in, and enjoyed a state-of-the-art soundproof existence. For the best view, request a southern-facing, upper-floor room that overlooks Charleston’s historic skyline.', 'Food and drink', 'Not a full-scale restaurant, but the lobby’s Veranda Lounge comes alive in late afternoon towards happy hour—or as The Loutrel calls it, “Charleston’s finest hour,” for craft cocktails and light bites, plus a menu of creative salads, flatbreads, and panini throughout the evening, with a lunch launch projected for May 2022. Breakfast is fully complimentary, a generous European-style buffet with eggs, cured meats, fresh fruit, house granola, muffins, and flaky pastries. There’s also a snack-filled mezzanine library with an impressive assortment of local books curated by Buxton Books on nearby King Street, so if you fall in love with a particular bound volume, you can stroll over to the bookstore to have it shipped home. As for nearby restaurants, there are too many to name, my favorites being FIG, Peninsula Grill, Husk, Hank’s Seafood, Cru Café, S.N.O.B., Miller’s All Day, Brasserie la Banque, and Fast & French. I’m sure I’ve missed some. Charleston is target-rich.', 'The spa', 'There’s no spa, but the on-site fitness room has weights, yoga mats, treadmills, and a Peloton bike that sees regular use. I personally prefer to hit the pavement (Charleston is immensely walkable) or to snag one of The Loutrel’s courtesy bikes to cover more ground.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The Loutrel sits at the northern edge of Charleston’s French Quarter, known for its Huguenot roots and art galleries. The Waterfront Park and pier are short blocks away, as are multiple churches, historic house tours, museums, the Gibbes art collection, and King Street retail shopping.

The level of service, in general, is friendly and relaxed, but attentive. It’s a small hotel, so you really get to know the faces.', 'Accessibility', 'ADA standards are well met, with a wide range of accessibility and features listed on the hotel’s website. It’s a state-of-the-art design, incorporating ADA sensibilities.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'The chief complaint voiced by hotel guests does not pertain to the hotel itself but to its unattractive neighbor: a low-flung, late-night convenience store across the street. But given Charleston’s current renaissance and building boom, surely this little lot will get snatched up by a savvy developer (fingers crossed) and recycled as the next Mercantile & Mash or Dean & Deluca.', 'Finally, in 100 words or less, what makes this hotel worthy of Hot List?', 'The Loutrel’s “wow factor” is its rooftop terrace, cresting the mature treeline of Charleston’s historic French Quarter. Early risers take morning coffee up here to watch the sun illuminate a sliver of harbor, or to lounge by day on cushioned wicker with a book from the Clubroom library, or to enjoy an evening sunset cocktail, or to stargaze late at night.

Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel,,2,"This hotel feels brand new, though technically it was redesigned and relaunched in 2017, so Renaissance is a perfect name.

The life-sized metal pig next to check-in hints at all the great BBQ you'll find in town, in case you needed that hint."", 'Nice. What’s the crowd like?\nAnyone and everyone, Marriott loyalists, business travelers, extended families (in connecting, ADA accessible suites), giggly little girls playing chase in the lobby.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nRoom numbers are engraved with images of Charleston door knockers, and entrance hallway ceilings sport the telltale superstitious “haint blue” believed to ward off evil spirits. Wood vinyl flooring feels both rustic and clean. Curated artwork in my Executive King drew my attention, especially the framed image of a folded starched shirt with bowtie and cufflinks as seen through an X-ray scanner. Whimsical black-and-white rabbits line the bathroom wall—a deliberate allusion (per the bellhop who brought up my suitcase) to Alice in Wonderland falling down the rabbit hole. I like this place. Oh, and Aveda products! (Insert smiling emoji here.)', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nTVs hook up to your Netflix and Hulu accounts so you can continue binge-watching. When you log off upon departure, you are discontinued, so no one else can access your accounts. The in-room coffee and tea maker carries Charleston Tea Plantation varieties (a working tea farm you can tour on nearby Wadmalaw Island). Free Wi-Fi for Marriott members but $14 a day for non (clearly they want you to join). With no hesitation, I would steal the pair of hanging bird cage chairs in the lobby—fanciful and surprisingly comfortable. Also, the framed art piece comprised of Dum Dums lollipop wrappers folded into tiny origami boats.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nChef Vivian Howard has got you covered. She’s the brains (and the beauty) behind the PBS television series \nA Chef’s Life\n. Her new Handy & Hot pit-stop branches off the hotel lobby, “open every dang day.” The bake shop serves fist-sized biscuits with sweet & savory fillings, and piping hot hand pies stuffed with delicious and surprising flavor combos like fresh ginger with sweet corn and onion. From heavier fare (pimento cheese grits and sausage) to lighter fare (chilled shrimp succotash) everything is portable if you wish. You can even order up a BBQ beach basket to-go for a small group. Hit up the Life Raft Treats cart for a locally made banana pudding ice cream popsicle dipped in dark chocolate. Chef Howard’s onsite restaurant Lenoir launches in fall 2020.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThere’s a small gym full of cardio equipment and free weights, if you want to work off some of those biscuits and hand pies. Plus an outdoor, heated saltwater pool on a rooftop, surrounded by cushioned sofas and chaises longues.', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThis is a top notch, Marriott branded, completely refurbished hotel with all the technological perks you would expect (with the only drawback being that Wi-Fi is free only to Marriott members; otherwise, you'll be dinged $14 a day). Better yet, it is situated on a lesser trafficked cross street downtown, so it feels hidden despite being in the center of everything.""]","68 Wentworth St., Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/renaissance-charleston-historic-district-hotel,http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/chsbr-renaissance-charleston-historic-district-hotel/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2

At the four early-19th-century in-town “singles” and two carriage houses that form Zero George, you don’t have to. The 16 rooms offer an unfussy palette of cream, gray, and sage, and not a lick of kitsch. Garden suites are sweet with heart pine floors and period millwork, and the kitchen is the heart and soul of this place, as should be the case in the South. Chef Vinson Petrillo isn’t about pretense or elaborate sauces; royal red shrimp are served with generous amounts of heritage pork fat. Zero Restaurant is a destination in its own right. This is classic Charleston, down to the deeply satisfying underfoot crunch of oyster shells in your shaded courtyard nook. ","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nTucked behind wrought-iron gates, you might think you\'ve trespassed into the meticulously manicured grounds of someone\'s private residence, or five residences to be exact—three restored ""Charleston singles"" and two carriage houses. Past the climbing roses and espaliered magnolia, a reception sign leads you up the stairs of the main 1804 building, where you\'ll be greeted on the veranda with a glass of bubbly.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nCouples mostly, of all ages, both well-heeled travelers and young romantics. Business travelers too, seeking an authentic Charleston home-away-from-home vibe. For travelers who wish to stay awhile, the hotel added five luxurious long-term suites in an adjacent 19\nth\n century building. Launched in Summer of 2021, The Residences include kitchens outfitted by Le Creuset.', ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nDespite being in a historic house, my Veranda Queen was not stuffy or dated. Pine flooring and a large fireplace anchored the room, with cream-colored wainscoting, and plantation shutters for leveraging light and privacy. Spotless Italian linens and modern lamps helped lighten things up. Bathrooms are on the small side, but they're state-of-the-art. Mine had a glassed-in shower, gleaming white subway tile surround, dual shower heads, and large dispensers of Malin + Goetz products. It's tempting to linger longer when you have richly lathered spicy rum body wash and a well-pressured rain shower. Bonus: enjoy a morning coffee or afternoon glass of wine on the room's porch overlooking the courtyard, with a linen drape for added seclusion. And speaking of wine, the complimentary daily wine & cheese spread reflects the fine taste of the couple who own this spot. Their picturesque Virginia winery Pippin Hill Farm & Vineyards is a truly divine destination"", ""How about the little details? Any of that worth a mention?\nA Nespresso machine hides within a custom-crafted armoire, as does a roll-out mini-fridge filled with complimentary Izze sodas and waters. At turndown, a rotating selection of locally baked Grey Ghost cookies appear, plantation shutters flip tight, lights dim, and the creams and golds in the room really glow. An optional bedside sound machine plays rolling ocean waves all night long (or country crickets if you choose), enabling a deep sleep, as does the sound-blocking magic of double window panes. The hotel's marine blue bicycles with leather seats are perfect for exploring the city or orchestrating picnics. Take your drink of choice or newspaper and wander behind the carriage house to find the hotel's hidden corner garden with a calming fountain, and love seats poised on crushed oyster shells."", ""Food and drink: What do they have here?\nA destination in its own right even for those not staying here, \nZero Restaurant's\n menu has shifted from a la carte to a prix fixe multi-course extravaganza (I counted seven courses including small bites). A petite candlelit dining room migrates to the open patio in good weather, so guests dine beneath palm trees, Japanese maples, and moonlight. Button-sized, tucked into the ground floor of the main house, Zero Bar revs up at happy hour with a speakeasy vibe, bespoke cocktails, and excellent bites, including a flight of deviled eggs and Chef Petrillo's whimsical take on a lobster roll. Rumor has it the chef has a few truffle-shaved burgers up his sleeve for those who know to ask. Starting in Spring of 2022, Zero George debuted a truly decadent Caviar Bar. Guests sit on the open porch for a stellar presentation of Regiis Ova Supreme caviar on ice served in fine silver, plus a bevvy of classic accompaniments: custardy eggs, lemon, brioche wedges, crème fraîche, etc., and wine and cocktails (or mocktails) to wash it down. It’s a great start to the evening, or a meal unto itself."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nZero George is pure Charleston fantasy for those who dream of owning a tasteful, historic peninsula residence... without the headaches of actually maintaining one.

20 South Battery,,2,"If you love HBO’s Gilded Age drama series, this is your chance to live that life. The mansion was built in 1843, pre-Civil War, but it’s the post-Civil War swagger of High Victorian Second Empire additions that make the house unrepentantly ostentatious, and wonderfully so. You can read Dickens on a velvet settee in the 5th floor library with windows open to harbor breezes. It’s time travel at its most decadent.","['Why book?\n Imagine having a grandiose historic house museum all to yourself, and being allowed to sit on the furniture. Settle in!', 'Set the scene:\n 20 South Battery looms large at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula. The five-story mansion faces the public park and the harbor beyond, so you’ve got White Point Gardens as your front yard, with night herons nesting in the branches of live oaks. You’ll be given a code to open the wrought iron front gate. Walk up the grand staircase flanked by marble lions, step into the front hall, and pinch yourself at the sight of the 2-story ballroom filled with period antiques and flooded with ambient daylight from a center sky-lit cupola. Pictures don’t do the house justice, because the scale of this place is meant to flood your peripheral vision.', 'The backstory:\n Although the carriage house has functioned before as an inn, this is the first time an owner has opened the mansion itself to hotel guests. Native Charlestonian Dr. Jack Schaeffer purchased the home in 2018 and spared no expense in restoring it to its Gilded Age glory, uncovering architectural secrets along the way, like the hidden trapdoor to a 19\nth\n century wine cellar. Outside, oystershell pathways and old brick lead back to a deep formal walled garden.', 'The rooms:\n It’s rare I’ve had the chance to sleep in a bed valued higher than a new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan. The main house 2\nnd\n floor Lathers Suite has just that: a mahogany four-poster carved in Cuba in the early 1800s, with a plush locally-crafted mattress (thankfully \nnot\n from the early 1800s). Wrap-around windows in my suite overlooked magnolia treetops and red slate roofs. My sitting room was heaven: an inlaid coffee table, bound books on shelves, black marble fireplace, and gilded mirror. Each room is unique, but all include a mix of antiques with some modern touches like smart televisions, Bluetooth alarms clocks, and an emerald-green fold-out sofa, very comfortable for a plus-one. Best of all, no 19\nth\n century bathrooms here, and no shared bathrooms either (as can sometimes be the case in old houses). The owner took great pains to create state-of-the-art private bathrooms for each room, with spacious soaking showers and gleaming white tile.', 'Food and drink:\n Although the hotel does not have a restaurant, they do serve individual cheese plates and nice, dry French wine (not the sweet stuff!) daily in the ballroom, where guests get to know each other and compare notes. Breakfast is included and very good: a smattering of croissants and quiches from local bakery Brown’s Court, plus biscuits made by Carrie Morey of Callie’s Biscuits fame (iced blueberry biscuits are the bomb, plus great gluten-free buttermilk biscuits as well). You can eat in the dining room, order breakfast via room service, or better yet, take it to the back garden. There’s nothing like sipping coffee on a joggling board or beneath a trellis of blooming jasmine and spying a bird’s nest in a nearby camellia bush.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n This is Position A in Charleston’s posh “South of Broad” residential district. Carriage tours and amble by, and you can wave as if you owned the place. You’ll love strolling through White Point Gardens and along the High Battery overlooking forts, dolphins, and sailboats.', 'The service:\n A small but dedicated staff run the house, so you’re never alone. If the owner is in residence during your visit (when he’s not traveling) he’s more than happy to chat, to walk you through history, and to share a drink with you in rocking chairs on the veranda.', 'For families:\n Children are welcome, but keep in mind that this home is full of valuable antiques (I’d hate to be the one to break a priceless mid-1700s sconce here).', 'Accessibility:\n Unfortunately, given historic preservation restrictions, this house is not ADA-accessible, and if you have any ambulatory issues, you’ll want to tread carefully, which is true for Charleston in general, where tree roots play bricks like piano keys.', 'Anything else?\n For a breathtaking sense of this property, check out the uninterrupted drone footage on the website’s opening page. It just takes a minute, but it’s jaw-dropping. The camera glides you from White Point Gardens towards the mansion, through the front door, circles the ballroom, then the front parlor, dining room, up the winding staircase through bedroom suites, out to the 2\nnd\n floor veranda, up to the 5\nth\n floor library, exiting the window over treetops to the harbor beyond.']","20 South Battery Street, Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/south-battery,https://www.20southbattery.com/

Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThe inn was no doubt visionary when it opened in 1987, but now feels a tad dated (the VCR player made me chuckle). Rooms are quirky and full of contradictions: huge but with tiny TVs, an eight-foot-wide bathroom counter but only one sink, window blinds that bump into each other when opened, and custom-tiled tubs so large that even a six-foot-tall person could float in them belly up. That said, I slept like a baby in my cushy queen bed, woke up to birdsong, made myself coffee with the in-room Keurig, and pretended I was a mermaid in the tub, with Beekman toiletries to boot. It was a good stay. Wi-Fi is free but sporadic. Being ""unplugged"" helped me focus on ""glamping"" (glamorous camping).', 'Room service: Worth it?\nGuests can eat a hearty breakfast or lunch at the Lake House, a short walk away, or head to the Clubhouse nearby for drinks and snacks (think wine and a game of chess, or beer and croquet). Also on the grounds is The Restaurant at Middleton Place, praised for its southern, seasonal, local fare, which will deliver to the room if you give them enough notice.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features?

For a truly indulgent, thoughtfully sourced Southern meal, walk over to The Restaurant at Middleton Place, for the likes of fried quail, toothsome shrimp and grits, Lowcountry Captain, and Hoppin' John."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nNot exactly hi-tech, but that’s not the goal here. With the right mindset, you’ll fall in love with this place: peace, quiet, gardens, nature, kayaks, bikes, hammocks strung between oaks and magnolias, a filling southern breakfast, and a stellar fine dining restaurant through the woods. It's worth more than a one-night stay, especially if you want to visit all three adjacent historic plantations (Middleton Place, \nMagnolia Plantation and Gardens\n, and \nDrayton Hall\n).""]","4290 Ashley River Rd., Charleston, South Carolina 29414, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/the-inn-at-middleton-place,http://www.theinnatmiddletonplace.com/

Few hotels in Charleston can claim direct views over water, and HarbourView Inn’s corner units have just that. The entire hotel was refurbished in 2021, so if you’re returning, you’ll find the rooms much refreshed. Order a cocktail and take it to the rooftop terrace to watch the sun set behind the Holy City skyline.","['Why book?\n Who doesn’t love being near \nwater\n? From the lobby and rooftop terrace, you can watch kids playing in the public fountain below, sweetgrass basket weavers on the pier, windsurfers, paragliders, and sailors in the harbor beyond.', 'Set the scene:\n The street Vendue Range was once Charleston’s historic wharf district, now populated with condos, hotels, shops, and art galleries. Head east until you hit the harbor, where you’ll find the inn. Walk through lobby doors, up the curved stairs, and into the 2\nnd\n floor lobby, surrounded by windows overlooking the water. On a hot day, it’s a blessing to hang out here, beneath whirling fans, with driftwood design features and a marble fireplace for winter.', 'The backstory:\n This hotel has long been a popular one, but it recently underwent a full-scale interior revamp, so it’s worth revisiting. The aesthetic is much lighter: gone are the traditional dark wood furniture and heavy green curtains, replaced by soft blues, pale creams, and woven accents. There’s a barely visible hint of blue tartan in the rug, and nice caning in the armoire.', 'The rooms:\n Not all of the 52 rooms have harbor views, unfortunately, because a new hotel is under construction due east, so you’ll need to request a balcony overlooking water if that’s what you’re after. (There’s a top floor suite with two private, furnished balconies, and a working gas fireplace, if you can snag it.) Personally, I prefer bedrooms in the hotel’s historic wing along Vendue Range. This wing transforms an old warehouse into lofty units with 14-foot ceilings, exposed brick, and arched windows. Some of these rooms have wide soaking tubs, but walk-in showers are more common. Technology is great and up-to-date, with well-placed USB ports, convenient outlets, and strong, free Wifi.', 'Food and drink:\n Although there is no onsite restaurant, the hotel sources breakfast goodies from local Saffron Bakery. You can take breakfast in bed (delivered to your room), on the rooftop terrace, or in the hotel’s atrium where multi-storied balconies overlook a sociable lounge below. The atrium is a great place to relax on couches, play board games, flip through newspapers, and here you’ll find fresh fruit, a Keurig, and infused waters. Room service is limited to breakfast and a cocktail menu (which certainly comes in handy). The harbor-facing lobby hosts daily wine and cheese receptions, plus evening milk and cookies.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n Head east to the pier, south to explore, west to shop. Dining venues are plentiful here, from Brazilian steakhouses to oyster bars, a great BBQ joint, seafood restaurant across the street, and a French brasserie a short walk south.', 'The service:\n There’s always someone on-hand to greet you at the main door, assist at the front desk, or deliver you a celebratory beverage. The inn is smooth and professional.', 'For families:\n Kids will enjoy the Waterfront Park and dancing in the high-jet fountain, plus there’s a Belgian ice cream place downstairs. Guests can borrow hotel bicycles to roam waterfront streets and to explore the nearby historic residential district, just a few blocks south.', 'Accessibility:\n Be sure to request the hotel’s ADA-accessible unit if needed, and there’s a lobby elevator if you want to bypass the opening staircase.']","2 Vendue Range St., Charleston, South Carolina 29401, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/charleston/harbourview-inn-charleston,http://harbourviewcharleston.com/

Of the 89 rooms, the best are the corner suites, where wraparound windows shed natural light onto low-key, unfussy interiors by Belgium’s Nicolas Schuybroek and Marc Merckx.

The wait staff in Café Robey and in the bars are friendly, casual, and familiar.', ""Imagine the other guests are part of a tribe. What's their deal?\n The Hipster Herd: Tattoos, shiny Apple laptops, ironic eyewear, local obscure clothing brands. Likely to have a green approach to their food, to be seen reading books and poetry by people like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Norman Mailer, and saying things like: “I liked them before they were cool.”"", 'What about the neighborhood anything notable nearby?\n Northwest of Downtown Chicago’s grand buildings, shiny skyscrapers, and wide-open greens of Millennium Park, The Robey’s proximity to Bucktown and Wicker Park is gritty and urban.

Los Angeles is next in fall 2019."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n Rooms come in three sizes: Snug, Cosy, and Roomy.

Furnishings are minimal; a single padded chair sits beside an end table with a retro-styled iPhone speaker. Inside the truncated bathroom are tiled walls and a marble sink. The shower holds locally sourced body washes.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n WiFi is free and adequate.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n Outposts from some of the city's hottest chefs are scattered throughout the property. On the top floor is Cabra, a Peruvian cevicheria by Stephanie Izard of Girl & The Goat. You can't go wrong with any of the kitchen's vibrant ceviches and fruity tiraditos, ut don't pass over the goat empanadas: tender meat in a supple shell served with a huacatay mayo.

There's a kumbaya spirit—here, gathered around craft cocktails rather than the campfire."", ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n Sandwiched between the Morgan and Clinton subway stops, the hotel sits two blocks from Randolph Street in the Fulton Market section of Chicago's West Loop, an area that was once a meatpacking district. Although the building is new, it was designed to blend in with the industrial, warehouse-heavy neighborhood. Just outside are some of the city's finest restaurants, including The Aviary, Au Cheval, and Girl & The Goat."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\n If you're angling for any semblance of additional space, be warned that the Cosy room category certainly errs on the side of its namesake adjective."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The Hoxton has one of the neighborhood's only rooftop pools. And don't overlook the local tidbits strewn about your room, including the key cards and bookmarks stuffed into bedside reading material."", ""Bottom line: Worth it?

Several unique features excite hotel enthusiasts including the sliding doors in every suite making for two distinct rooms and little extras like yoga mats, signature red sofas, and street level prices on mini bar snacks and sodas. And while the pool is certainly posh, it’s the Commons Club that is seemingly sitting pretty as the cornerstone of the property. A member’s only vibe with an open to the public policy ensures that everyone gets a dazzling drink and a delicious meal in Dallas, darling.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\nThe hotel is in the Design District, which is full of business-friendly chain hotels like the Courtyard by Marriott and Best Western, which makes the Virgin, with its neon red signage and geometric white exterior, stand out. When you walk in, the colorful, playful design ethos of the brand comes through immediately, and it almost feels as if you're in a different world."", ""What's the backstory?\nVirgin Hotels is, of course, run by British magnate Richard Branson, whose hospitality empire includes airlines, cruises, and space travel. This is his third hotel, after openings in \nChicago\n and \nSan Francisco\n, and the vibe is similar. The hotel's public spaces have a clubhouse-like feel, and you feel as if you've stepped in Branson's exclusive world."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nThe rooms are pretty standard in size and look similar those in San Francisco and Chicago, but there are quite a few features that show the design team\'s attention to detail. Every room has a privacy door, a safety feature that allows staff to enter the room (for room service or other deliveries) without entering the main bedroom. The mini bars have ""street pricing,"" which means you\'d pay the same for a bodega down the road, as opposed to the 200% markup you might see in most mini bars. And there\'s both a large bathroom mirror and a well-lit vanity mirror, a fantastic amenity for female travelers.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nNo charge. One login gets you into the Wi-Fi for both the rooms and the public spaces.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe restaurant, Commons Club, is run by local chef Matt McCallister, who also helms \nHomewood\n, a superb destination for Italian food. New American comfort foods are the focus at here, including pastas and grilled meats. Don't overlook the cocktail list, which nods at classic concoctions and their origins. And the café serves Laughing Man Coffee, the side project of actor Hugh Jackman."", 'Anything notable about the service?\n The Virgin Hotel lacks a proper front desk, but there is a staffer who greets guests upon check in and provides all the necessary information for a quick, seamless arrival. The hotel was still working out some kinks while we were there, such as the bar service and the valets, but these are all issues that can be easily fixed with time.', ""What type of travelers will you find here?\nDallas' young, partying crowd flocks to the bar on weekends, particularly hovering around the much-Instagrammed circular swing that hangs below a neon sign. There's tons of outdoor space at the restaurant, which are the seats of choice for the see-and-be-seen crowd. But the best place to people watch is the rooftop Pool Club, with a large pool and a Jacuzzi for chillier nights."", ""What about the neighborhood? What else is around here?\nThe hotel stands out in this area, which is set slightly away from Dallas' main nightlife hubs. But don't miss a visit to the nearby Bishop Cidercade, where a $10 entrance fee gets you access to unlimited arcade games, and cider and wine is served on tap."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nI would have loved a little more design focus in the rooms, but the public spaces more than make up for it, with plenty of artsy surprises around every corner."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\nMy favorite space was the Funny Library, which has plenty of seating room and board games for a quieter night in.', ""Bottom line: Worth it?\n Yes. It's a fabulous new addition to the Dallas hotel scene, and it's impressive to see how Branson's design and hospitality translates in this massive city.""]","1445 Turtle Creek Blvd., Dallas, Texas 75207, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/dallas/virgin-hotels-dallas,https://virginhotels.com/dallas/
W Dallas - Victory,,2,"This hotel's proximity to the American Airlines Center (AAC) in Victory Park makes it key for anyone visiting for a basketball game or concert. The suites are massive (some more than 1,000 square feet) and offer fabulous views of the Margaret Hill Hunt Bridge. Taking a happy hour dip in the hotel’s 16th floor infinity pool feels like you are living on the edge… of Dallas anyway. Cook Hall, the restaurant can book up on busy game or concert nights, so you may have to make a reservation if you want to dig in to their lobster gnocchi.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThis hotel's proximity to the American Airlines Center (AAC) in Victory Park makes it key for anyone visiting for a basketball game or concert. I was intrigued to check out the neighborhood as it continues to grow adding chic shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nLots of sports fans.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThe suite was huge (over 1,000 square feet) and had a living room, bedroom, and open concept bathroom. Subtle Texas accents like cowhide furniture and bandana wallpaper reminded me that I was in Dallas despite the hotel feeling fairly modern overall.', ""What's the deal with wi-fi?\nThe internet is $9.95 per day if you are not an SPG member."", 'What do they have for food and drink?\nCook Hall offers a little bit of everything for every kind of eater—from short rib spring rolls and lobster gnocchi to duck tacos. It often gets a pre-game and concert rush so make a reservation if you are planning to indulge in dinner on a busy night at the AAC. It is also open for breakfast and lunch. Bonus points for having a solid kids menu.', ""Anything other features that were real stand outs?\nThe pool, dubbed the Wet Deck, is a party on the 16th floor. Although it claims to be for hotel guests only, it seems like there is always some type of an event going on that attracts locals who are looking for a good spot to day drink. It can be truly relaxing if you are able to score a little sun poolside on a weekday when it's quiet. Taking a happy hour dip in the infinity pool feels like you are living on the edge…of Dallas anyway."", ""What's the bottom line?\nIf you are moving and shaking in Victory Park this is absolutely your best bet. Not only are you steps from American Airlines Center, but you are able to walk to multiple restaurants, shops, and other scenic city sites. The only person I would not recommend this hotel to is one that tends to favor classic luxury. While this is certainly upscale, it is anything but traditional in decor and vibe.""]","2440 Victory Park Ln., Dallas, Texas 75219, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/united-states/dallas/w-dallas-victory,https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dalwh-w-dallas-victory/

You'll see just about everyone here—a wedding party, a young family headed to the pool, or a group of golfers. (The resort has access to not one, but two courses.) The Spanish colonial-style villas are the go-to here, with space for the whole family and views of the golf courses. If 18 holes isn't enough activity for you, the resort also offers top notch fitness facilities: think jogging tracks, an indoor lap pool, 12 tennis courts, and a group exercise studio with more than 40 classes a week like aerial yoga.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nDriving up to the property in Las Colinas northwest of Dallas, I'm taken by the Spanish colonial-style architecture and the beautiful grounds. When you're in Dallas proper, it is easy to forget how lovely large stretches of impeccably maintained grass can be. Here that grass is part of two 18-hole golf courses—TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas and Cottonwood Valley."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nDespite the Four Seasons label, this hotel feel laid back, so you'll find a great mix of people. While sitting in the lobby for any extended amount of time you are likely to see a guys golfing group, a wedding party, and a young family headed to the pool."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nI stayed in a premiere villa suite, which has quite a bit more going on than the entry level rooms, and it was well worth it. There was a lovely living area complete with a fireplace that was perfect for entertaining. There was a full bathroom in addition to a powder room and the large dining table was perfect for enjoying meals as a family. My favorite area was the wraparound terrace and its views of the TPC course.', ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nDon't underrate a good turndown service. Here it helped to keep the room clean and zen."", 'What do they have for food?\nLovers of locally sourced meats will go nuts for LAW, which stands for ""Land, Air and Water."" Executive chef Christof Syré serves up Akaushi beef from Beeman Ranch in Harwood and scrumptious redfish from Copper Shoals Farms in Port O’Connor. The quail and chicken are also locally sourced. LAW\'s master sommelier, James Tidwell, will help you select the perfect pairing for your dish of choice. In-room dining here is also an absolute luxury. My meal of choice? Breakfast! Start with a large pot of La Colombe coffee and ease into things with a Texas pecan twist or a piece of banana bread. For your main meal, I would suggest Huevos Las Colinas, with two eggs, tortilla, avocado, black beans, queso fresco, and ranchero sauce. So good (and \nso\n Texas).', 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe driver of the mini shuttle who transported us from check-in at the main resort to our villa suite was helpful, personable, and offered us some tips and tricks to score the best seats at the two outdoor pools.', 'Anything we forgot to ask about?\nThose who enjoy staying active on vacation will love this resort and its fitness facilities. Think jogging tracks, an indoor lap pool, group exercise studio (more than 40 classes a week), 12 tennis courts, and two golf courses. My favorite class? AntiGravity aerial yoga for the win.', ""What's the bottom line?\nThe Four Seasons feels like home, and to me, that is priceless. This hotel is warm and welcoming to the entire family.

Any of that worth a mention?\nAs one would expect with a Ritz-Carlton property, the amenities were aplenty and included a complimentary shoe shine, twice daily housekeeping, and a fully stocked snack bar.

You’re so close to the stadium that you might almost feel like the pitcher could bust out your window with a particularly robust fastball.

Take, for instance, the leather-panel walls with exaggerated red stitching in the lobby café, which captures the essence of a baseball and glove.

You’re so close to the stadium that you might almost feel like the pitcher could bust out your window with a particularly robust fastball.', ""Set the scene:\n Don’t be fooled by the proximity to the action: Once you walk through the front door, the rowdiness of the stadium fades away, and you’re whisked into a surprisingly sophisticated boutique hotel experience. The Rally doesn’t shy away from its baseball theming, but it's more conceptual than overt.

The memorabilia that \nis\n on view, including signed bats and balls and bases, is housed in dimly lit cases that look more like an elegant museum display than a theme resort."", 'The backstory:\n The hotel debuted last spring as part of the first phase of McGregor Square, which was developed by the co-owner, chairman, and CEO of the Colorado Rockies, Dick Monfort. His résumé didn’t exactly scream developer or hotelier, and \nThe Denver Gazette\n reported that when lenders inquired about his previous experience in the area, he touted that he’d once built a meat-packing plant. Luckily, he turned to experts in the field, with the Denver-based Sage Hospitality Group chosen to operate the hotel; they’ve played a major role in the city’s boutique hotel scene, and they’re equally as well known for their clever adaptive reuse of historic structures (\nThe Crawford Hotel\n) and their stewardship of classic properties (\nThe Oxford Hotel\n) as they are for their ground-up constructions (\nThe Source Hotel\n). If you’ve spent any time in LoDo, chances are you’ve witnessed their work.', 'The rooms:\n The subtle baseball theming continues in the 182 guest rooms, which feature plaid carpeting in the colors of the Colorado Rockies and leather headboards that might make you feel like you’re sleeping curled up inside a giant catcher’s mitt. The in-room art nods to Americana, with works like local photographer Kimberly Wolff’s print of the kitschy Rabbit Ears Motel in Steamboat Springs. In the adjacent stadium, purple seats mark 5,280 feet above sea level (the 20th row of the upper decks), and the hotel nods to that high-elevation benchmark with its own Mile High Floor, the eighth, which is done up in purplish hues inspired by the state’s sunsets.', 'Food and drink:\n Leaning into the all-American vibe of its stadium-side location, the onsite restaurant The Original is proudly vintage, with a menu that plays on diner standards. Think deviled egg flights (pimento, buffalo and blue cheese, and everything bagel), doughnut sliders, duck fat matzo ball soup, and chicken pot pie. Decidedly less retro are the monthly drag brunches. The Rally Bar, meanwhile, classes up ballpark staples with snacks like 7X Ranch Wagyu sliders and the most artfully plated mini corn dogs you’ve ever seen—all under a spiraling glass-bauble chandelier.', 'The neighborhood:\n As part of the area’s decades-long rejuvenation story, Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo) has been welcoming a series of glossy, multi-use developments, from \nUnion Station\n to the \nDairy Block\n. The newest, \nMcGregor Square\n, made its grand debut last spring on the site of a former Coors Field parking lot, and it’s a decidedly family-friendly affair, complete with a food hall, a sports bar with more than 115 HD TVs, and an outpost of the city’s beloved Tattered Cover bookstore. The hub is a buzzing central plaza with a sloping patch of grass that’s the perfect spot from which to watch Rockies games on the 66-foot-by-20-foot LED screen.', 'The service:\n The staff members are professional and laid-back, and they’ll be sure to remind you to take advantage of “social hour” at the lobby’s grab-and-go Grandstand Café; every day between 4 and 6 p.m., guests can grab a free cocktail, beer, or wine and a scoop of ice cream in a souvenir Rockies helmet.', 'For families:\n If you’re traveling with kids, you can request board games, cards, and even s’mores kits from the front desk upon check-in, and there are eight bunk-bed suites equipped with classic video games.

Life House Lower Highlands,"Hot List, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",1,"The first hotel in Denver’s hip Lower Highlands neighborhood sits quietly on a residential street. It’s easy to mistake the nondescript façade for just another apartment  building, but the cement exterior—a nod to the industrialists who built the city—is part of the carefully crafted narrative that’s become a signature of the Life House  brand. Inside, the lobby feels like a prospector’s Victorian home, with Louis XVI Bergère chairs, velvet drapes, and cowhide throws; the 16 rooms upstairs range from king suites to bunk rooms. Its restaurant, Wildflower, keeps the story going with a menu honoring the neighborhood’s original Italian and Mexican settlers. At the low-lit bar, a young crowd sips old-fashioneds, bringing the story full circle from frontier outpost to modern urban epicenter of cool. ","['Why book?\n If you were to move to \nDenver\n, you’d want to live in its coolest neighborhood, Lower Highlands. The first hotel in LoHi, as the locals call it, transports guests back to another era with its Western frontier meets Victorian homestead design. Excellent cocktails and Italian-inspired fare at Wildflower make it a destination for both locals and visitors.', 'Set the scene:\n Stepping into Life House Lower Highlands feels like a time warp; just like that, it’s the 1800s. A vintage Victorian-era Cabinet of Curiosities stocked with vintage glassware, turquoise jewelry and beaded Western hats replaces the typical hotel retail shop and a pair of Louis XVI Bergere chairs upholstered in floral prints await arriving guests in the lobby. You’d half expect to see Victorian-era ladies or Wild West cowboys at the adjacent low-lit bar but instead, the crowd of 30-something creative cool kids and urban adventurists don Danner boots and Filson flannels. A soundtrack of Wilco and Johnny Cash sets the mood at one of LoHi’s hottest new watering holes.', 'The backstory:\n Hotel industry veteran Rami Zeidan founded Life House in 2017; the brand bills itself as the first Silicon Valley-backed hotel in the U.S. Its first property debuted in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood and that was followed by a second in Miami Beach and a third in Nantucket. Tennessee, Brooklyn and Bali outposts are scheduled to open in 2021. The brand takes the concept of storytelling to the next level with intricate narratives for each hotel that firmly root it in place and shed light on the history of the building and the destination. The Lower Highlands narrative, for example is: “A Victorian Industrialist’s Frontier dwelling with a musing for Western wildflowers.” It can feel a bit theatrical but at the same time informs visitors and residents about local culture (i.e. the Italian and Mexican influences in Denver). They’ve become known for their affordable price point and for turning the low-brow bunk room into stylish digs worthy of grown ups with good taste.', 'The rooms\n With just 17 rooms, Life House feels more like a friend’s home than a hotel—in a comforting way. Interiors pay homage to Colorado’s wildflowers and cowboy past with a color palette of Prussian blue, rusty red, and mustard complemented by honey-colored leather and cowhide. All of the millwork is bespoke, made with Life House’s furniture partner in Bogota, Columbia. Modern takes on vintage botanical paintings hang next to black-and-white artwork of cowboys and Victorian-era ladies. Bathrooms are a highlight, featuring 10-inch rain shower heads and ceramic tiles as well as Le Labo bath products. If you thought bunk rooms were for kids, think again. These aren’t the rickety twin bunks of your youth. Bunk rooms range from four to eight luxuriously comfortable beds each.', 'Food and drink:\n The restaurant and bar are the heart of the hotel. Chef William Harris came from Denver hotspot \nLinger\n and his menu of subtly Italian-influenced dishes is all about quality ingredients. Most, like the Colorado bass featured in the crudo, are local. A handful are imported, like the heavenly burrata sourced weekly from a farm in Apulia, Italy. The bar program is a standout in the city. The Wildflower negroni and smoked old fashioned are staples. There’s also a deep natural wine list and interesting selection of meads. In the morning, the cafe has a half-dozen breakfast items and a unique selection of wellness lattes in flavors like pink beet and blue butterfly pea.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n Lower Highlands is undeniably Denver’s hub of food, cocktails, coffee, craft beer and cool kids. Now, there’s finally a hotel that allows out-of-towners to experience the neighborhood’s creative energy. Life House is walking distance from popular local spots including \nAvanti food hall\n, Black Eye Coffee, Prost Brewing Company and Ash’kara restaurant. Life House’s Victorian-age design elements are a nod to the hood’s Victorian-era architecture.', 'The service:\n You don’t stay here for five-star service or over-the-top amenities. You book a stay to be based in Denver’s center of cool at an affordable hotel that has character, stellar drinks, and friendly, low-key staff. The Life House app makes everything touchless, from check-in to chatting with the concierge and connecting with other guests. An online blog curates the best of the neighborhood with posts sharing insider intel like the founder of Method Coffee Roasters’s favorite neighborhood spots.', 'For families:\n While bunk rooms could accommodate families, the layout and overall vibe of the hotel caters to 20 to 30-something groups of friends.', 'Eco effort:\n The commitment to supporting local purveyors, from coffee roasters to \ncraft brewers,\n and local artists and artisans is exceptional.', 'Anything left to mention?\n I loved that each room has a yoga mat and that the TVs stream yoga and fitness classes from Sky Ting Yoga. The hotel partners with Ranchlands and can arrange day-trips and overnights at their ranches, including Chico Basin, so guests can experience Colorado’s frontier spirit first hand. The custom wallpaper layers the Colorado landscape over Victorian-inspired elements and if you look closely you’ll find Victorian figures and objects hidden in the woods and mountains.']","3638 Navajo St, Denver, Colorado 80211, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/denver/life-house-lower-highlands,https://www.lifehousehotels.com/hotels/denver/lower-highlands

The hotel is part of the Aparium group, which operates properties like the \nDetroit Foundation Hotel\n and the \nPontchartrain Hotel\n in New Orleans, known for their individual character rather than their adherence to some arbitrary brand standard.', 'The rooms:\n When conceptualizing the Clayton’s 63 modernist-tinged rooms, the designers at AvroKO drew on influences including the state’s prodigious peaks and striated geology, regional timber architecture, and even the history of the gold rush. The decor is minimal, but rooms are filled with unique details to fall for, including rosy-hued, half-frosted mirrors, banquette-style seating, and light fixtures in brass and fluted glass. Luxuries come in many forms here, from the textural (Sferra linens, Frette terry robes) to the technological (Dyson hair dryers, smart TVs) to the purely practical (bedside wireless charging pads).', 'Food and drink:\n Folks like to tout Denver’s 300-ish days of sunshine a year, and the restaurant at the Clayton specializes in food that seems designed to be eaten under an umbrella with your toes in the sand. In fall 2022, New York’s Quality Branded group opened Kini’s, a Greek island–inspired restaurant with a menu of shareable dips (beet muhammara, whipped goat cheese with saffron apricots), wood-oven-roasted seafood (Galician octopus, branzino), and heartier entrees like grilled lamb chops with smoked cherries and filet mignon au poivre kebabs. Joining it in November is Cretans, a new Mediterranean wine bar.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n There’s a bit of a corporate sheen to Cherry Creek, a polished shopping and gallery district about a 15-minute drive from the buzzier stretches of downtown Denver. While there are plenty of local shops in the area, businesses skew more toward big names like West Elm, Chico’s, Whole Foods, and Vineyard Vines. That’s not a bad thing, per se, but if you’re coming to Denver to explore its newest restaurants and bars, be prepared to spend a little money on rideshares. For something a bit closer to home, the neighborhood is a perfect jumping-off point for the 40-mile Cherry Creek Trail.', ""The service:\n Don’t let the members' club moniker fool you: Service here is warm and casual, with a staff that might remind you of your favorite neighborhood baristas. In other words, you’ll feel cared for but not pandered to."", 'For families:\n The hotel offers cribs and rollaway beds upon request for younger guests, but this is a property that’s gear more toward millennials.', 'Accessibility\n: ADA amenities include widened guest room doorways, roll-in and transfer showers, and bathroom grab bars.', 'Anything left to mention?:\n Denver is one of America’s most proudly active cities, so you’ll be happy to have access to the fitness center, which includes Peloton bikes and Woodway treadmills.']","233 Clayton Street, Denver, CO , Denver, Colorado 80206, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/denver/clayton-members-club-and-hotel,https://claytondenver.com/

Beyond dining, everything you need can be found inside The Venetian.

Yes, even if you have actually been to real Venice. The Venetian and its sister tower,\xa0\nThe Palazzo\n, are both a part of The Venetian Resort."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nThe Venetian and Palazzo complex is so enormous—more than 7,000 rooms and three million square feet of retail and meeting space, there's absolutely no way to categorize the travelers you see at this hotel. They run the gamut from conventioneers of all kinds to people who know and love the Venetian, to people checking in to the massive Canyon Ranch that spans both hotels."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThe Venetian has made much of how all its rooms are suites. They are all quite large (the standard size is 650 square feet, and they go up from there). Especially if you are here on business, the step down in each room from sleeping area to a small living room, with desk and big flat screen television, makes a huge psychological difference. All the suites have been recently refreshed, too, to keep pace with Strip-wide renovations. (And this is before the $1 billion renovation the Venetian announced in late 2022.) I've stayed in both a Luxury Suite (the standard, with a king-sized bed) and a Bella Suite (essentially the same layout, slightly larger, with two queens). All done with cream-colored walls and neutral carpets but with jewel-toned accent chairs, they're more modern and definitely lighter than they were a few years ago."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe Venetian's beds are pillow-top custom mattresses that are really soft and high and are topped with a big duvet. The bed can seem a bit...royal, since it has big heavy curtains on either side (they don't go all the way around, but they're what you'd imagine a Renaissance-era bed would have had) and there are big heavy bolsters on the bed."", 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThe mini bars at The Venetian are pretty standard, with electronically sensored refrigerators (like most casino hotels). I pulled out a Diet Coke and then realized it was one of the mini bar sized 7.5-ounce bottles (not a regular 12-ounce can), which was annoying.', ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nThe bathrooms at The Venetian are great: There are separate showers and soaking tubs, the finishes are sleek stone and there are double sinks in the vanity. My favorite feature is the small makeup table, though, and the mirror whose lighting you can switch to daytime or nighttime. It's a nice extra feature."", 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nStrong enough for streaming and covered in the daily $39 resort fee.', 'Food & Drink\n\xa0Venetian has always played a major role in the food scene in Las Vegas (especially in the celeb chef arena), and it has recently made some welcome changes. Eyal Shani’s HaSalon has opened, bringing legit Israeli food to the Strip; Estiatorio Milos relocated its incredible seafood (and best lunch deal around) from Cosmopolitan; and Mott 32 is some of the best Chinese food (in a seriously dramatic room—dress up!) you can have on the Strip.', ""Room service: Worth it?\nEven though The Venetian, like most all casino hotels, charges a delivery fee ($7) and attaches an 18 percent gratuity and taxes on top of it for room service, their in-room dining is really good. It's an entirely separate kingdom in Venetian, since it has to serve 7,000 rooms, sometimes multiple times. It has all the standard stuff—continental breakfast, chicken fingers—but adds items that are inspired by its 40 (!) restaurants and has a really good vegan menu. For instance, you might steer toward a Japanese Breakfast (organic salmon, a poached organic egg, pickled vegetables), or order a plate of American cheeses from Beehive Creamery, Old Chatham, and Roth. You can even order bone broth. Touches like cannoli from Buddy V's are nice, and the prices overall are slightly lower than\xa0\nWynn\n\xa0and\xa0\nCaesars\n."", ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nI'd award trophies to the in room dining staff. With so many rooms to serve, it's a miracle that your order gets there in the time frame they promise (let alone at all)."", ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe gym is actually a Canyon Ranch (a real one). You can go on the climbing wall, get nutritional counseling, and even have your gait analyzed. It's also the spa, and there are a lot of extras here, like acupuncture, that you wouldn't find at a regular hotel spa. There are around 40 restaurants in the Venetian, which started overhauling its culinary program several years ago and now has what can arguably be called the best restaurant selection in Las Vegas"", ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe most memorable thing about the Venetian is the huge array of restaurants, and the fact that everything you need can be found inside the hotel. More than even Caesars, this is an entire city in a hotel and it functions like one. It's great for people who want to go to Vegas and plant themselves in one place."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThe Venetian has some of the best room deals going. Depending on the season and who's in town for conventions, you can get one of its suites for as little as $179 a night. I always check the resort calendar, which shows you the (highly variable) room rates. The deals are easy to find, and if you think about how much you'd spend finding a cheaper room off the Strip (not much less than this rate, by the way), Venetian is actually kind of a bargain in the end.""]","3355 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/las-vegas/the-venetian,https://www.venetian.com/

In recent years, the Cosmopolitan has focused on upping its offerings for bigger spenders, and its rooms reflect that: The Chelsea Penthouses, for instance, start at 2,400 square feet, and the three-bedroom penthouses have terraces with panoramic views. All the rooms, though, appeal to those who love clean-edged design. The hotel was acquired by MGM Resorts International in 2022 and is operated by Marriott, and is now part of a new brand collection, the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, that gives Marriott members special access and points on stays, and you can book through MGM or Marriott.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds are great—with lots of big pillows.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nA lot of the rooms have different kinds of bathrooms and different layouts, but I liked my Tower One Bedroom a lot because it had a really deep Japanese soaking tub with a view of the Strip.', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nIncluded with the $45 daily resort fee.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0Cosmopolitan has long had some of the Strip’s most standout restaurant and lounge options, and they’re constantly adding fun new things. One of the newest is The Barbershop Cuts & Cocktails, a swanky room behind a janitor’s door where you can take in a major whiskey selection and yes, actually schedule an old-school shave and haircut. Other new additions include David Chang’s fun new Bang Bar by Momofuku at Cosmopolitan’s stellar Block 16 Urban Food Hall. Its classics, like é by José Andrés, Jaleo, Scarpetta, STK, and Zuma never lose their luster. The wacky “Italian American Psychedelic” restaurant Superfrico is fun (try the Detroit-style pizza) but its hidden Ski Lodge based on ski chalets in Hokkaido is the real find. They’re all within one of the best people-watching places in Las Vegas.', ""Room service: Worth it?\nCosmopolitan's in-room dining is pretty snack-heavy (not like traditional hotel IRD, which has plenty of entrees) and there are a lot of healthy options and share plates (nachos, hummus) that assume you'll be entertaining in your room. But you'll pay a premium for ordering IRD, especially considering the fact that there are great options right downstairs, like Eggslut, Estiatorio Milos, Ghost Donkey, a juice bar. I didn't order breakfast like I usually do, because not only did one continental breakfast order cost almost $30, it also comes with a $7.50 delivery fee plus 18 percent service charge and tax. If you're really holing up in your room for any length of time and money's no object, it's likely a fine option."", 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe staff here is good, but maybe not quite as standardized and en pointe as, say, Wynn.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe restaurants are absolutely key at Cosmopolitan—some of the best in Las Vegas and definitely the most scene-y. Virtually everywhere you go, you'll run into the beautiful people. There are three levels of bars under one, massive Chandelier, and Vesper Bar is one of the prettiest on the Strip. The spa has, since Cosmopolitan opened, been one of the best in Las Vegas. There's a huge, fabulous hammam that adheres pretty close to Moroccan tradition."", ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nIf you're staying in Vegas, you'll likely end up at Cosmopolitan at some point, since this is where some of the best restaurants, and almost bar none the best people-watching can be found. It's especially good for social Millennial types, since there are plenty of places to just hang out. For those who want a break from all the expected luxury retail, Cosmopolitan offers some edgier shopping options than elsewhere on the Strip."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThe rooms are big and there are lots of different room types—so it pays to research exactly what you want before you go, and request a specific room if you can. There are some really good room features, like terraces (since many Vegas hotel rooms don't have open-air spaces). Service can be a little spotty, though, and since you're paying some of the highest room prices on the Strip, you'd better really like the nightlife and restaurant scenes, because the social scene is really what you're paying for.""]","3708 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/las-vegas/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas,https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/
Bellagio,"Gold List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2018. Readers' Choice Awards, 2019. Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",3,"When this Lake Como–inspired wonderland opened in 1998, it instantly become the model for the over-the-top Vegas extravaganza resorts that would follow; its fountains remain the biggest free show in town. The Strip icon could have rested on its reputation, but the Bellagio has taken the last couple of years to reinvest in the experience for its guests—not just those who walk in for the spectacle. The Chicago firm The Gettys Group Companies, in partnership with MGM Resorts International Design Group, oversaw a full renovation of all 2,568 guest rooms in the main tower, taking design cues from the fountains with natural stone and pops of aqua; in some rooms, vast showers replaced the old tubs. But even as it modernizes, the resort has smartly realized it can’t get rid of its icons. The hotel is currently renovating its Spa Tower to the tune of $110 million, in jewel tones Champalimaud Design is borrowing from Lake Como and the Alps; this is where to check in for a more residential feel.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThere's a reason Bellagio's lobby is one of the most Instagrammed locations in Las Vegas (as is its Conservatory). It can be argued that Bellagio ushered in the era of the super-resort in Las Vegas. Sure, we already had themed hotels like Luxor and\xa0\nMirage\n, but the 20-year-old Bellagio signaled absolute luxury when it was built. The lobby hasn't changed much, with its massive installation of Dale Chihuly blown-glass flowers all over the ceiling and the naturally-lit conservatory just beyond, but it still feels like a fabulous garden party whenever you walk in."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nBellagio gets a huge variety of travelers these days. A lot of the people you'll see in the hotel are here to gawk at the Conservatory, which was modeled after conservatories Steve Wynn had seen in France and changes its displays—which are made of tens of thousands of flowers and kinetic sculptures—with the seasons. With so many people here to see the famous dancing fountains and other public sights, it's hard to categorize travelers. Needless to say, however, this hotel is busy from all the foot traffic. So the lobby is almost always busy-to-crowded."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nResorts in Las Vegas are constantly updating to compete with their counterparts on the Strip. In 2015, Bellagio renovated all of its nearly 4,000 rooms at a cost of $165 million. Only a few years later, it has refreshed all 2,568 rooms in its main tower (for those of you who love a bathroom with good lighting, the backlit mirrors encircled by mother of pearl are for you). Bathtubs are out, giant marble showers are in. And all the room redesigns, done by The Getty’s Group with MGM Resorts’ own design group, are inspired by the water (think Bellagio’s fountains), light and nature. They feel light, modern, and thoroughly unexpected for Las Vegas. The rooms start at 510 square feet, so are on the large end for standard rooms. The hotel is currently renovating its Spa Tower to the tune of $110 million, in jewel tones Champalimaud Design is borrowing from Lake Como and the Alps, and this is where to check in for a more residential feel. There are lots of different room categories, so if having a view of the fountains is important to you, the best thing to do is call the reservations people on the phone and work with them to request a specific room.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nSome of the rooms have specially branded pillow-top Bellagio mattresses or Serta mattresses. The bedding is luxurious, and I like the fact that you can call housekeeping and request hypoallergenic pillows.', ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThere are some seriously useful things in Bellagio's mini-bar, like a universal electronics kit (packaged in nice Bellagio boxes, just like the honey mustard pretzels and other snacks). Before actually spending the money on that, I'd call the front desk or housekeeping and request the use of an adaptor. Tip: You might not know that you can actually buy access to the Chairman's Lounge, which is like a club floor lounge. It comes included if you reserve a suite, but you can add it to a Fountain View King or Queen for $100 per night. (My recommendation: Since room prices are so variable because of conventions and special events, do the math on just springing for a suite or upgrading your room with the purchase of a Chairman's Lounge package.) You'll likely recoup your money in food alone, since there's a rotating selection of snacks and treats."", ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nBathrooms at Bellagio are good-sized, and they have marble vanities, lighted makeup mirrors, and big soaking tubs. Bellagio has its own branded bath amenities, and you'll also get some useful extras, like razors, sewing kit, cotton pads."", ""Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-Fi here is solid, and it's included in a higher-than-usual daily $45 resort fee."", ""Room service: Worth it?\nBellagio doesn't go too crazy with exotic in-room dining offerings, although they do have vegan and gluten-free options. It's expensive, like most, but they're fast at bringing tables in and also clearing them away, so you'll never have to worry about having to step over trays people have lazily shoved out their doors. Two great perks on the menu are an all-day breakfast and caviar service (since there's a Petrossian downstairs adjacent to the casino, you can order a tradition caviar service, complete with buckwheat blinis, toast points, creme fraiche, and at least three different kinds of caviar all to your room)."", 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nEach season, Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden’s 120 horticulturists, engineers, and designers create unbelievable displays (new plants and trees, massive animatronic characters, and once, a 110-foot-tall deceased banyan tree from Palm Beach, Fla, weighing 200,000 pounds). They create all this magic behind the scenes and assembled it under the 50-foot-high glass ceiling seemingly when no one is watching. It’s one of the most incredibly well-orchestrated productions in the world.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe restaurants, like\xa0\nPicasso\n\xa0and\xa0\nLago\n, are some of the most romantic in Las Vegas, and if you call in advance (and ask nicely), you'll likely be able to secure a table with a great view over the fountains. If you’re very into a fountain view, have brunch at Spago, which sits virtually on top of them. Overall, the restaurants and public areas of Bellagio, while extremely busy, are also some of Las Vegas's must-sees."", ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe most memorable thing about staying in Bellagio is that you're in the middle of the action. It not only has great restaurants, but a very good (though small) art gallery and a new Perrotin Store Las Vegas, which sells art and artis-made objects as well as books. Bellagio has fantastic retail, of course (Breguet gets some of the rarest of the watch brand’s traveling collections), but the most remarkable thing about this luxury hotel is how democratic it is. You really can just come in to see the sights."", ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nEspecially since the renovations, the once slightly tired hotel rooms have all been seriously perked up. Since the entry of higher priced hotels on the Strip, Bellagio's prices seem slightly gentler, and you can get a lovely renovated room for not much more than you'd pay for a room off the Strip. It's a great deal.""]","3600 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/las-vegas/bellagio-las-vegas,https://bellagio.mgmresorts.com/en.html?icid=GMB_Hotel_Bellagio#/
The Palazzo at The Venetian Resort,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2018. Readers' Choice Awards, 2019. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"The Palazzo is the extravagant younger sibling of The Venetian (both are part of The Venetian Resort) and was planned around the same kind of Renaissance Italian aesthetic. Each of the hotels has its own rotunda entrance; on the Palazzo side, rather than being all gold, there's an amazing crystal sculpture of women that's actually a two-level fountain. It's both modern and reminiscent of classical sculpture. It has the largest standard rooms on the Strip—700-square-foot bilevel suites with L-shaped sofas—and a slightly quieter atmosphere than Venetian’s family-forward vibe. Venetian and Palazzo have always had so many dining options, but in recent years, they've really turbo-charged the hip options, like Rosina, an intimate, Art Deco lounge right at the base of the guest room elevators in Palazzo. And the Prestige upgrade is well worth the money for the largest standard rooms on the Strip, and at less money than a hotel room in most other cities.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThe Palazzo is the extravagant younger sibling of\xa0\nThe Venetian\n\xa0(both a part of The Venetian Resort) and was planned all around the same kind of Renaissance Italian notion.

It's both modern and reminiscent of classical sculpture."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nThere are so many guests in The Venetian and Palazzo, whose combined rooms number around 7,000—and many visitors may just be there to see a show, dine in one of the 40 restaurants or gamble—that it's impossible to tell what the demographic is just by looking around. What is apparent, though, is that it's a hugely diverse crowd. It does have one of the more upscale crowds."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nI stayed in one of the Luxury Suites, which are the standard rooms. They're remarkable because they're huge for standard rooms. Considering the fact that you can actually score one of these rooms for $199 (depending on the season and which conventions and events are in town at the moment), these are some of the best deals in town. They're about 100 square feet bigger (and feel wider) than their Venetian counterparts, and the largest standard rooms on the Strip. They were last upgraded in 2018, and are much brighter and feel more modern than the Venetian side."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds, like Venetian's beds, are sky-high pillow tops and are some of the best beds on the Strip."", 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThe mini-bar, like most in Las Vegas, is expensive and electronically monitored. I loved, though, that it had its own special packaging for offerings like little canisters of gummy bears and Godiva chocolates.', ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nThe bathrooms in Palazzo's luxury suites (the standard suites) are some of my favorite among standard rooms in Las Vegas. They're big, with 17-inch TVs (in case you like to watch TV while you're getting ready), and like Venetian, have a great little makeup table with an additional lighted makeup mirror that you can turn to different settings for daytime and evening light."", 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-Fi is covered in the daily $45 resort fee.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nPalazzo has the same in-room dining menu as Venetian (and the same 18% included gratuity plus $7 delivery fee). If you don\'t mind the extra cost, this is one of the in-room dining menus in Las Vegas that\'s really good. Much better than the expected chicken/salmon/steak entrees, you can order from a really creative vegan menu, plus get unexpected items like tiramisu pancakes, chicken and waffles (hangover food!) and a whole prix fixe Italian menu. ""Seaside in Venice,"" a five-course menu, is a great reason to stay in and have an intimate evening a deux.', 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nI think the in-room dining staff, who flawlessly execute deliveries for 7,000 rooms, some several times a day, are the real heroes of Venetian and Palazzo.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nSince you're likely staying in Palazzo because you love the Venetian/Palazzo complex but are looking for an upgrade, I think the best idea is to book one of the Prestige suites on the concierge floor (23), which gives you access to the Prestige lounge, plus little perks like afternoon tea, Champagne at check-in, and personal concierge assistance (which can be invaluable when you're trying to get hard-to-book show tickets at the last minute). One of my favorite things about Palazzo is that is has recently gotten into public art, installing some incredible pieces in the Waterfall Atrium. It's an ever-evolving collection that makes the Palazzo feel relevant and fresh."", ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nVenetian and Palazzo have always had SO many dining options, but in recent years, they've really turbo-charged the hip options, like Rosina (an intimate, Art Deco lounge right at the base of the guest room elevators in Palazzo). You can also stay at Palazzo and have a wildly different experience than your partner. For instance, the elevator bank at Palazzo goes straight to Canyon Ranch (it spans Palazzo and Venetian, but the spa side is on the Palazzo side). You don't have to wander a casino floor in your bathrobe; you could go spa all day while your partner gambles, and you'd feel like you're at a destination spa (because you are!). Palazzo also has more upscale shopping options than the Venetian (although they're connected), and the Atrium—which is a curated luxury shop of accessories, watches and cosmetics—is such a fun place to find something special for yourself (or as a gift) without all the wandering you'll do around Venetian."", 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nPalazzo, especially the Prestige upgrade, is well worth the money.

Circa Resort & Casino,,1,"Until Circa opened in October 2020, no new hotel had been built in Downtown Las Vegas for 40 years. What a tribute to all the fun and wackiness of the area; the place has distinguished itself as an unapologetic, adults-only temple of fun. It plays to a pretty specific demographic: sports lovers who come for its Stadium Swim pool complex—pool, lounge seats, sports bar, and bungalows all facing a massive, 40-foot-high HD TV that always has a major game playing. For dining it has the obligatory Las Vegas steakhouse, but also a pan-Asian eatery that’s both an ode to the Midwest and to Las Vegas, and a fantastic (if very expensive) deli.  There’s plenty to keep you inside this resort for days, but you could easily venture out to the funky dive bars, the (wild) people-watching, and the galleries of the 18b Arts District, all just steps out the front door. And if it’s views of the Vegas Valley you want, Circa’s Legacy Club, a partly open-air lounge on its 60th floor, has some of the best. (You can enjoy them Vegas-style next to 500 custom gold bars and a ticker that shows their fluctuation in value in real time.)","['Why book?\n\xa0In a city of superlatives, it seems Vegas was lacking a few things, like Nevada’s longest bar and the largest sportsbook in the world, as well as massive pool area facing a 40-foot-high screen devoted to professional sports watching. Circa has stepped in to fill that void.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0For years, Downtown Las Vegas has been threatening to gentrify. With the continuing renovation and expansion of the Fremont Street Experience, the rotating programming at the Mob Museum, and the renos in the Arts District, it’s come a long way. But until Circa opened in October 2020, no new hotel had been built here for 40 years. And what a tribute to all the fun and wackiness of Downtown. The soaring, streamlined tower was an instant landmark, and the place has distinguished itself as an unapologetic, adults-only temple of fun. It plays to a pretty specific demographic: sports lovers who come for its Stadium Swim pool complex—pool, lounge seats, sports bar and bungalows all facing a massive, 40-foot-high HD TV that always has a major game playing. (A major perk here is that the pools are always heated to between 78 and 94 degrees, which sounds odd in the city’s 100-plus-degree temps, but is so crucial. Vegas hotel pools can be shockingly cold.) Those same, hard-partying sports aficionados love the three-story, amphitheater-style sportsbook, which seats 1,000 people in stadium seating and private boxes for viewing on the 78-million-pixel screen. Even with all its high-tech features, Circa is meant as a paean to Downtown’s golden era. You’ll see plenty of old-school touches, like Vegas Vickie, the 25-foot-tall reclining neon cowgirl who used to grace the Glitter Gulch casino and now greets guests just past the lobby, and in the swanky 60th floor rooftop Legacy Club (with a case of 500 gold bars whose fluctuating value you can see on a ticker above them).', 'The backstory\n\xa0Derek Stevens, who developed and owns Circa, has been betting on Downtown since the early 2008, when he and his brother Greg Stevens bought The Golden Gate and later Fitzgerald’s, which he renovated and transformed into The D. The Michigan-born sports fanatic and auto part manufacturing company owner bought the Las Vegas 51s baseball team, built the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center, and finally went really big with Circa. While this part of Downtown was attracting plenty of looky-loos to the circus that is the Viva Vision light show over Fremont Street (and to get spit out of Slotzilla, the slot machine-themed zipline that travels over it all), Circa ushers in a new demographic. They’re a well-heeled crowd here to have fun, bet real money, and pay up for some of the best new dining experiences in town.', 'The rooms\n\xa0Circa’s standard rooms are refreshingly straightforward king rooms configured in different ways depending on whether you’re traveling as a couple or a group. In other words, no one is looking askance at those who are rolling with a crew and need a pull-out couch (such as in the “flex king” room). The contemporary-leaning mid-mod vibe of the rooms is all masculine chocolate browns, white and navy—heavy on functionality and low on fluff. If you’re planning on some in-room entertainment, the suites, which range from 822 to 1,612 square feet, are the way to go. Think full wet bar and refrigerator and black quartz dining tables. The rooms come with a variety of views, but we think the view over Stadium Swim is the most fun.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0Circa was not messing around when it came to not only installing the obligatory\xa0\nLas Vegas steakhouse\n, but also a pan-Asian eatery that’s both an ode to the Midwest and to Las Vegas, a fantastic (if very expensive) deli, and some other good dining. Barry’s Downtown Prime Steakhouse moved in when Chef Barry Dakake exited the Palms, and this venue occupies a sexy space lit by an artificial tree in one room, and with lots of little nooks for intimate dining in booths and a wine rack-enclosed private dining room. Major standouts include braised beef short ribs with harissa, surf & turf elevated as filet medallions with Maine lobster and truffle aioli, and a truly eye-popping 40-ounce tomahawk ribeye. Dakake is only sourcing from humane farms and doesn’t serve foie; and though it’s a tabernacle for carnivores, there’s also a great vegan menu. Don’t miss the pan-Asian eatery 8 East by local culinary celeb Dan Coughlin, whose Le Thai has been a Downtown standby for years (he learned to cook from his Thai mother and he’s a bit of a culinary celeb around these parts). Saginaw’s Deli is another standout, opened by the owner of famed Michigan deli Zingerman’s. Its Royal Flush Reuben is not cheap but will easily feed two (or four).', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0The Fremont Street section of Downtown is like the blowsy old lady in your neighborhood with red lipstick on her teeth who you can’t help but love for her general wackiness. It was the original Vegas before the multi-billion-dollar production values of the Strip and elevating it to contemporary Strip standards—even with all its high-tech tourist attractions—is a heavy lift. But Circa is doing just that while staying true to the unapologetically hard-partying nature of the neighborhood. The entrance, right on the Fremont Street Experience, is a glittery nod to 60s and 70s-era glam. There’s plenty to keep you inside this resort for days, but you could easily venture out to the funky dive bars, the (wild) people-watching, and the galleries of the 18b Arts District, all just steps out the front door. With so much to do, you might not even make it to the Strip.', 'The service\n\xa0Service here is friendly and accessible—but also totally capable. Like other of the best concierge teams in Las Vegas, they’ll make tee times, remind you about games, suggest things to do around town, help secure concert tickets. Las Vegas is all about having connections—and they’ve got them.', 'For families\n\xa0Circa is the only hotel-casino in Las Vegas that limits its guests to those who are 21 and older. In other words, this is not a family-friendly destination.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0Circa is fully accessible, with pool access ramps, wheelchair-accessible restaurants, van parking, accessible meeting spaces and business center, as well as a fitness center that’s accessible.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0You won’t want to miss an evening at Stadium Swim. During the day, it’s a full-fledged party (there’s a certain cruise ship feel to the pool and screen scene). But at night, sitting in a rooftop pool looking out at all the old Vegas icons that surround you is one of the most nostalgic feelings you can have—even if you never experienced Downtown in its golden era.']","8 Fremont Street Experience, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/las-vegas/circa-resort-and-casino,https://www.circalasvegas.com/
Vdara Hotel & Spa,,2,"If you want to feel like you're checking into a destination spa, Vdara may be the hotel that comes closest in Las Vegas. The lobby has soaring ceilings, and the whole hotel—although it's a glass high rise in ultra modern CityCenter—is built to maximize light and bring in natural materials. It's the only completely non-smoking AND non-gaming hotel in Las Vegas. The spa is one of the nicest in the city, plus never as crowded as, say, Qua in Caesars, or one of the other spas in large casino resorts—there's a meditation lounge, waterfall, wooden floors—definitely a go-to spot while you're here. While Vdara has slightly higher room rates than some comparably sized hotel rooms, and upgrade is worth a little extra money for all the extras you get: Studios have little kitchen areas so you're not always going in search of food, and if you're staying for a while, there's no reason to skip the laundry service you can access.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nIf you want to feel like you're checking into a destination spa, Vdara may be the hotel that comes closest in Las Vegas.

It's the only completely non-smoking AND non-gaming hotel in Las Vegas, so it feels and smells super-clean."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nThe travelers who stay here are looking to go to a casino on their own terms, rather than having to pass through a casino floor on the way to their rooms. These are the ones who bring their yoga mats on vacation, or are here strictly to do business and not bother with the chaos of most other hotels.', ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nEvery room is a suite in Vdara, although there are a half-dozen suite categories. I've been in the City Corner Suite (a tough get!), which is just under 800 square feet and feels modern in black and white, with floor-to-ceiling windows and views of the Strip or the mountains. (If you want a fountain view of Bellagio, you can call in advance and ask if it's possible to put you in one of the high floors, which have partial views of the waterworks.) One nice feature is that the rooms were designed to feel residential, so all of them have features like refrigerators (that you can put your own things in), dining tables and electric cooktops. The corner suite (which is the middle category) and up have full kitchens and a Keurig coffee machine. So if you were going to be staying in Las Vegas for a while, Vdara would be a comfortable place to dig in."", 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep.

The bedrooms are separate from the living areas—and have good views—so they feel quite civilized.', ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nOne of the nice amenities here is that rooms have access to a washer and dryer, so you don't have to pay a zillion dollars for laundry (that is, unless you want it done for you), and you can call housekeeping to provide things like detergent. The mini-bar is fairly standard, with items like sodas, nuts and candy, although the items are less expensive than most on the Strip."", ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nSeparate glassed-in showers and big soaking tubs, great plush robes and Aveda amenities make you feel like you're in a destination spa.

When you walk into Wynn, it’s an otherworldly fantasy where retail boutiques have their own backyards and an entire, lush par-70 championship length golf course hides behind the resort—the only golf course on the Strip. Behind the marquetry doors of Delilah supper club, names you would know mingle under the soaring cast-brass palms that evoke icons like L.A.’s Cocoanut Grove and the Tropicana Club in Havana, while Casa Playa serves dishes from Mexico’s Pacific and Atlantic coasts to a packed house of beautiful people. The Overlook Lounge, meanwhile, is a sumptuous redo of the central lounge, and offers a menu of cocktails infused with edible perfumes. In the last several years, Wynn has been on a spree, opening a Gucci with the only Gucci Garden in the US, a jaw-dropping Louis Vuitton with exclusive objets, and even a supercar store by McClaren, and renovating rooms to the tune of $200 million. There’s a reason Wynn has remained the city’s resort gold standard since it opened some 17 years ago—and it continues to gild the lily.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nWith its sunlit atriums, indoor koi pond, and fountains and waterfalls in multiple locations throughout the resort, you’ll recognize immediately why Wynn is the largest Five-Star resort in the world. When you walk into Wynn's main entrance, it's a totally otherworldly fantasy where retail boutiques have their own backyards and an entire, lush par-70 championship-length golf course hides behind the resort—the only golf course on the Strip. You walk across floral mosaic tiles into a naturally lit lobby full of moving floral sculptures—like a flowery carousel surrounded by trees and giant floral bouquets hanging from the ceiling. There's a reason this is one of the city's most Instagrammed spots. You feel you've walked in off the Strip into an alternate universe. It manages to pull this off and feel magical—not cheesy."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nIt changes depending on who's having a business off-site or a convention at Wynn and Encore. But in general, guests are fashion- and status-conscious. They're here for the amazing retail (there are two Chanel stores), the restaurants, and the nightlife. There's no distinct demographic, but they're s more sophisticated and international crowd than in most other resorts on the Strip."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThe hotel is constantly upgrading, and Wynn recently unveiled a $200 million renovation of 2,700 guestrooms in Wynn and Wynn Tower Suites with whose custom-designed furniture, wood accent walls, and commissioned Cubist-style artwork are just the start. Gorgeously lit baths with custom-designed etageres, faux bois wallpaper, and alabaster pendant lights feel like a residential sanctuary. (You, too can live like this: Wynn at Home, which you can find downstairs, sells many of the objects and furnishings, and they do a brisk business.) The floor-to-ceiling windows had a great view toward the Strip and west toward the mountains, and features include lights you can customize depending on your mood,and a bedside iPad that controls everything from the TV to the drapes, lighting, and in-room dining. a. The rooms are all quite large—generally starting at around 650 square feet.', ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nYears ago, Steve Wynn actually procured sheets from the top hotels in the world and made sure that his thread counts were higher. So you'll find sky-high beds with linens that are 507-thread count (putting them just above the highest-ever thread counts). For those of us who like to work in bed, there are huge, over-stuffed Euro shams, which are nice when you're trying to get comfortably propped up."", ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThese rooms are definitely designed to solve every traveler frustration. Wynn's own amenities are really nice: Three years ago, they had Molton Brown design a custom Wynn set of products, scented with cocoa and tonka bean,so you smell vaguely like vanilla. They also provide a basket that goes beyond the normal little amenities, including shoe polish and a buffing cloth."", ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nAll of Wynn's bathrooms are great, with a priority on big, deep bathtubs. The bathrooms are designed with a nice, Euro sensibility (which puts the toilet in a separate little room). The towels are the best on the Strip—really big, white and fluffy. Robes are big and plush. These are the first items we’d steal in a lawless world (we’re not advocating it—just buy them at the home store)."", ""Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nAll rooms get a free basic Wi-Fi package with a speed of 7MB (which is not really free—it's included in the $45 daily resort fee, from which you can't opt out). You can upgrade to faster Wi-Fi if you want to stream, but it'll cost around $15 per day."", 'Food and Drink\n\xa0 Delilah, a reconceptualization of The h.wood Group’s celebrity-filled West Hollywood restaurant, opened in 2021 and has since been on a consistent hot streak as the toughest table to get in town. The supper club is reminiscent of the city’s midcentury golden era. Think Cubist paintings, malachite-inlaid tables, dual staircases that open into a dining room that surrounds solid brass palms (think LA’s Cocoanut Grove or the nightclubs in Havana in their heyday). No detail was overlooked here—even the lounge’s upholstery is vintage Hermes.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nI could not possibly love in-room dining for breakfast more at Wynn. However, you\'ll pay for it. On a recent trip, I ordered a ""fitness breakfast"" (egg white omelet with vegetables, toast and fruit), plus a green juice and tea, and paid $69 once the service charge and taxes were levied. There are tons of options on the menu though, including traditional Asian breakfasts and vegan options. The new resort-wide “Living Well” menu extends to IRD, with options like gazpacho and a roast vegetable bowl. And if you’re a green juice devotee (raises hand), the Vibrant Vert here is hands down the best green juice ever.', ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nEvery staff member at Wynn is trained within an inch of their lives to make your life easier. It's impossible to single out just one overachiever here."", ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nBetween Wynn and Encore, there are multiple, gorgeous pools, Jacuzzis, and lots of ways to get to them. They're rarely crowded like the pool party scene at other resorts. The restaurants are all incredible—and one of the most pleasant and transporting scenes is sitting out at Jardin and watching the pool scene at Encore."", 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThere are three things you should definitely do when you’re at Wynn: Have a romantic meal in one of the restaurants that sit over water (such as SW, Lakeside, or at the floating pagoda table at\xa0\nMizumi\n); splurge on something really special on the esplanades at Wynn; and take in the wildly imaginative, reconceptualized evening show at Lake of Dreams. One of the most transporting experiences: having an evening cocktail at Aft, which you’ll swear puts you on the back of a superyacht on the Med, and is between SW and Lakeside on the show lake. You’ll find everything in the retail scene here from the only Gucci Garden in the US to a two-level temple to Hermes, to six- and higher-figure watches, to Wynn-exclusive shoes made by designers only for one season.', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nWynn is more expensive than other hotels in Las Vegas, and with good reason. Many people don’t come to Las Vegas, they come to Wynn—and never leave during their stay. Overall, because of the high number of hotel rooms in Las Vegas, it pays to get the one in the resort that you think you'll be spending the most time in.""]","3131 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/las-vegas/wynn-and-encore-las-vegas,https://www.wynnlasvegas.com/

You'll be greeted by name when you arrive at the lobby on the 23rd floor, and there's no line for check-in. The true pièce de résistance? No gaming, which means everything is blissfully quiet. And if you're skeptical of the pool scene in Vegas, you'll love this one, arguably the most civilized, mellow, and sophisticated little spot in the city. You can hole up for an entire afternoon and relax without thumping music or bumping into the bachelor party in the next cabana.

It's a minimalist-elegant lobby that feels residential, because it is. A certain number of people actually live here full-time and enjoy all the hotel's amenities. It can be a little confusing when you enter because you won't find the lobby until you take an elevator to the 23rd floor, which is where the restaurants and tea lounge can also be found. Best of all, there's no gaming in this hotel, so it's blissfully quiet. And there's no waiting in line to check in, in fact, the bellman calls up to registration to let them know you're on your way, so by the time you arrive on the 23rd floor, they're ready for you (and greet you by name)."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nWith some of—if not the—most expensive rooms on the Strip, it's not a huge hotel (fewer than 400 rooms), and the service is the absolute pinnacle of Las Vegas. The people who stay here are accustomed to high levels of service around the world; they're generally international travelers with a sophisticated sensibility and they demand excellent service."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThere are around seven different room types, and I've stayed in a standard room, which is called Cityscape Room here. Even though it's considered standard, at 500 square feet, it's still larger than many New York City apartments."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds are wonderfully soft, with goose-down pillows and duvets and fluffy white linens. (I think you can ask for different pillows if they're too soft for you.) There's housekeeping service at least twice a day."", ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nMy room came with lots of nice little extras, like a full-sized container of eucalyptus bath salts by the tub and an electric tea kettle, which is nice if you like your tea at all hours and don't want to call down for it. A very intuitive screened remote lets you control everything from curtains to lights from wherever you are, and it's not difficult to figure out."", ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nI love a good bath, and the Cityscape Room has a wonderful, deep bathtub. However, I like to bathe in private and the only thing that separates this bathtub from the room is frosted glass. It's fine if you're traveling alone or love the intimacy of bathing when your partner is also hanging out in the room, but if you're in the bath for some alone-time, you'll want to go with one of the other room categories."", 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nThe Wi-Fi is super fast and included in the resort fee, which is $45 per night.', 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nAll the staff is amazing—absolutely the best of the best. (And there are some lovely service holdovers from when this hotel was a Mandarin Oriental, such as when the valets take your ticket with both hands.)', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nYou absolutely must have tea at the Tea Lounge, which is a traditional high-tea with tiered trays of little sandwiches, scones and sweets, and comes with a long menu of amazing and rare teas. At night, the SkyBar has the absolute best views of the Strip in one of its most sophisticated little rooms. It feels like a great secret', ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe most memorable thing, and my most favorite thing, about this hotel is its pool. I don't love pool scenes in Vegas, but this is the most civilized, mellow and sophisticated little pool in Las Vegas. You can hole up for an entire afternoon and relax without thumping music or feeling like you're getting checked out by the bachelor party in the next cabana.

But if price is not your priority, book one of the larger suites and settle in for some of the best dining, service and luxurious living you can get in Las Vegas.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",2,"Aria is a sleek, curvilinear building, complemented by contemporary features such as a water wall and public art displays. The people who are checking into Aria are generally keen on staying in a more modern building, and like the proximity to high-end shopping (it's in the same CityCenter complex as The Shops at  Crystals). When you walk in from the valet, you feel like you're in a monumental glass atrium. There's almost never a wait at registration, and the lobby feels so spacious that it never has that cramped, crowded feeling that other casinos have. The spa is also one of the best on the Strip, with a salt room and an incredibly relaxing section with heated beds, which are imported from Japan and made of a single block of stone.

The rooms are also completely non-smoking (there's a serious fine if they catch you), so you don't have that lingering 1980s-era smoke smell that some casino rooms have, even when they claim to be nonsmoking. In general, guests at Aria have paid a premium over other hotels, so they're often professionals here on business, or well-heeled vacationers."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nI've stayed in both a Deluxe Strip View King in Aria and a One Bedroom Aria Suite in its Sky Suites. The rooms in Aria proper are lovely: They're all good-sized (starting at 520 square feet), with huge, upholstered headboards, high beds with firm mattresses, and dark woods and chrome finishes—all with floor-to-ceiling windows. The technology is great, too. Every room gets an iPad to control music, curtains and lights. If you pay the premium for Sky Suites, though, you get a lot of extras. There's a complimentary ride from the airport; private check-in (Sky Suites have their own elevator bank); a private lounge that has snacks going all day long plus wine and cheese in the afternoon; and a private Sky Pool. The 420 Sky Suites were all recently renovated, too, with spa-like bathrooms and a lighter, brighter color palette, as well as mod Vitra armchairs and comfortable wingback headboards. Depending on the day (tip: All MGM properties show you the rates for months in advance so you can plan), the premium you pay for the extra 500 or so feet and all the perks might only be $200-$300 per night. Not bad when you consider all the things you get."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds in both types of rooms are great.

Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nThere's no question that I'd steal that tablet—if, in fact, it could control every aspect of my life outside the hotel as efficiently as it does inside the hotel. I didn't play with it that much in the regular Aria room I had, but I believe that the tablets are upgraded for Sky Suites, and you can order in-room dining, make appointments at the spa, and of course control all the features of the room (lights, curtains) from the comfort of your bed."", 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nThe deluxe king room in Aria has a great bathroom, with dual sinks, a separate shower with a bench (which I appreciate), and really good lighting. But if you love a fab hotel bathroom, that upgrade to the Sky Suites might be worth it in the bathrooms alone. Think heated, automatic close toilet seats, beautiful lighting, and a deep, middle-of-the-room soaking tub. Sliding doors either give you privacy or allow you to talk to your travel companion in the next room.', ""Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nThe Wi-Fi is 10MB, so perfectly strong enough to stream, and it's available all over the resort. The resort fee is a slightly-steeper-than-most $51 daily, but Wi-Fi is included."", 'Food and Drink\n\xa0Aria has always had some of the Strip’s most memorable restaurants, and some of the best additions in recent years include Din Tai Fung, the cult-favorite dumpling palace that specializes in xiao long bao (Shanghai-style soup dumplings), filled with crab and pork, or truffle and pork in a stylish room. Other winners are the buzzy Cathédrale and Catch (especially its epic brunch). It recently revamped its old buffet space into a great food hall, Proper Eats.', ""Room service: Worth it?\nThe menu isn't giant or all that unusual (although I did once order the red velvet pancakes, and they were a very delicious sugar bomb). It's a pretty standard but beautifully presented in room dining experience. And you can order pizzas that you can personalize, plus some really nice touches like house made salt and vinegar chips with bleu cheese dip (which are really good)."", 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe concierges in the Sky Suites lounge are incredible. The couple of nights I stayed there, I watched them deal with everything from people trying to get last-minute, impossible show tickets in other hotels to just incredibly high-maintenance travelers with approximately one thousand questions with incredible grace.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe spa is one of the best on the Strip, with a relaxing salt room and an incredibly relaxing room with heated stone beds (they're imported from Japan and made of a single block of stone). If you're traveling with a significant other, you'll definitely want to come to this spa, since it is one of the few that has a good co-ed area. The co-ed balcony pool is just small and intimate enough to relax with your S.O. and has a great view of the three pools below. Dining in Aria is a force to be reckoned with.

MGM Grand Hotel & Casino,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2019.",3,"When you picture Vegas, you picture MGM Grand—with Cirque Du Soleil shows, roaring lions on display behind glass, and raucous bachelors’ parties likely coming to mind. It's impossible to casually list reasons to stay at the hotel, because it pretty much has… everything. It’s the largest hotel in the U.S. and the third largest in the world. In addition to the 6,852 rooms available there's an expansive range of experiences at an equally wide range of prices, with basic rooms for less than $100 depending on the season, to ultra-luxe suites that go for thousands of dollars a night. In 2022, it completed a 700-room renovation of its Studio Tower, reminiscent of midcentury desert glam of the city’s Golden Age. No matter where you sleep though, the appeal of the iconic casino, the five swimming pools, endless entertainment, nightlife, and dining options, and the Strip itself are reasons enough to make MGM Grand an ideal home base for any Vegas trip.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nIn the Skylofts, you feel like you've been let into some kind of delicious secret with these suites. You'll take a private elevator from MGM's grand tower to the Sky Lobby on the 29th floor, and from there, you'll be whisked to one of the 51 two-floor, loft-style accommodations high above the Las Vegas Strip."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nYou might see other Skylofts guests, but likely not. This is a fairly private crew, although you may see them in the Sky Lounge, which, as the name suggests, is for the exclusive use of Skylofts guests. They're young and hip, and/or high rollers at the hotel who have been invited to stay. They're a well-heeled group."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nI've been in both the one-bedroom and two-bedroom lofts (they have up to three bedrooms). Depending on the time of year, you can actually score these lofts for less than you might think. While the listed prices are between $2,000 and $5,000 per night and the one-bedrooms are 1400 square feet, we have seen prices as low as $1042 for the one-bedroom—a great deal, considering the fact that your stay comes with transportation to and from the hotel (maybe even in the hotel's Rolls Royce Ghost); VIP everything and no standing in line; and private butler service. They'll even stock your room with whatever you want before you arrive, and draw a bath for you."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep.

Skylofts were the first to get televisions embedded in the mirrors, and you can watch TV from your cool, infinity-edged bathtub (which also incorporates color therapy, in case you feel like turning the place into your private spa).

What’s the word?\nThe Wi-Fi is great and included in the $44 resort fee.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nSome of the restaurants in MGM Grand offer room service to Skylofts, and Skylofts staff do tell you that they can make virtually anything happen. So if you have the scratch and want to orchestrate an in-room dining experience with a restaurant, you might as well ask!). The in-room dining menu at MGM Grand is also good, with options like burgers and pizza you build yourself, and a good variety of mostly American choices (salmon, filet mignon, sandwiches). If you decide to entertain in your loft, you can order from their catering menu.', ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe butlers really do whatever you'd like, from stocking your kitchen with snacks (no, you don't pay extra for them) to tracking down toiletries, drawing a bath, delivering flowers. And the concierges in the exclusive lounge make sure you don't wait in line and have preferred seating in restaurants and in the shows."", ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nSkylofts doesn't have its own pool or gym but it's just a short trip down your own elevator bank to all the attractions of the massive MGM Grand."", 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe most memorable thing is the view! All the rooms have double-height windows in the living rooms. Make sure you speak to the concierge, though, about precisely which view you want.', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThese rooms would be perfect for a milestone anniversary or a honeymoon.

Then again, if all you really want is some kind of grab-and-go breakfast, your options are limited (there is the coffee bar, Press, in the lobby, but you'll hike a ways to find the Starbucks in Mandalay Bay).

This makes sense, because the downstairs restaurant,\xa0\nVeranda\n, has one of the\xa0\nbest breakfasts (if not the best) in Las Vegas\n, and the menu is pretty similar."", ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nI'm always amazed by the door staff. They're your first indication that you've stepped out of the giant casino realm of Las Vegas: The valets aren't harried, you'll never open a door yourself, and it's always totally pleasant."", ""Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe spa at Four Seasons is small but totally lovely. It's all natural woods that are reminiscent of the desert that surround you. One of the best little perks of this Four Seasons, though is the walk-in nail spa. Most people won't realize what a rarity this is; but, in fact, you're not able to bypass a big spa experience in any other hotel if you just want to get your nails done. The nail bar in Four Seasons is expensive but a great little place to relax and get your nails done before a meeting or night out if you don't have time for the spa."", 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nVeranda, the inside-outside Italian restaurant in Four Seasons, is actually one of Las Vegas\'s best places to go for a power breakfast. You\'ll see agents, rock stars, casino execs, movie stars. And the staff recognizes all the regulars. Happily for guests, you can only book a cabana if you are a guest of the hotel (unlike other pool areas, where anyone can book), so the pool scene stays small, intimate and mellow. There\'s no ""scene"" here, which is fabulous for people who just want to relax and not be bothered.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0Although Four Seasons Las Vegas has one of the most tranquil pool scenes on the Strip, open only to Four Seasons guests and completely without the spring break-style chaos of other resorts, families will love that they also have access to the Mandalay Bay Pools complex, which has a real sand beach (2,700 tons of sand, to be exact),a lazy river, villas for rent, a 1.6 million-gallon wave pool, and a lazy river. Just in case tranquility is not what everyone in your party is seeking.', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nThe rooms are enormous and luxurious, and with their recent update, are worth the extra money—especially since you're in recognizably Four Seasons-quality surrounds, with notably fewer guests than a regular Four Seasons, since it occupies only four floors of Mandalay Bay (but has its own entrance).""]","3960 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/las-vegas/four-seasons-las-vegas,https://www.fourseasons.com/lasvegas/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",1,"Everyone knew of chef Nobu Matsuhisa’s restaurants when he opened his first hotel here in 2013, but its debut marked the beginning of a new era for the renowned restaurateur—and for the city’s storied hotel scene. Within the behemoth that is Caesars, it ends up being a surprisingly intimate stay: Few hotels can pull off the boutique-within-a-hotel concept and feel as if they are truly an individual experience. When you walk into the very small lobby (of what was once the old Centurion tower), it feels as Nobu and Rockwell Group imagined it—very spare and Japanese, with beautiful touches like wood walls resembling what could be a Louise Nevelson sculpture. The Rockwell Group’s 2022 rethink of the rooms inspired by kintsugi, the Japanese art of gold epoxy-veined pottery, gives them a warm, residential feel. And if you’ve ever dreamed of picking up the phone and having the amazing food of Nobu delivered right to you, your time has arrived. It’s easy enough to go to the restaurant downstairs—the only Nobu that serves breakfast—but you should absolutely take advantage of the in-room dining while you’re here.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nWhen Nobu first opened in 2013, it was the absolute first of its kind from Nobu Matsuhisa. Everyone knew of his restaurants, but it was his first hotel. Within the behemoth that is Caesars, it ends up being a surprisingly intimate experience: Few hotels can pull off the boutique-within-a-hotel concept and feel as if they are truly an individual experience. So when you walk, right off the main floor, into the very small lobby of what was once the old Centurion tower, it feels very intimate and as Nobu and Rockwell group imagined it, very spare and Japanese, with beautiful touches like wood walls resembling what could be a Louise Nevelson sculpture.', ""What’s the crowd like?\nThe travelers who come to Nobu are smart. They love the intimate feeling of a boutique hotel, with its great touches (tea on arrival, great bath amenities) and the Nobu restaurant just downstairs, but they're also right smack in the middle of the action of Caesars, if they want to go to the clubs or to a show at the Colosseum, or to the completely over-the-top dining experience that is Bacchanal buffet."", ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nNobu has some of the nicest (and most original) suites in Las Vegas. Much has been made of the Rockwell-designed Nobu villa, the 10,300-square-foot rooftop villa with its own Zen garden that virtually every celeb has stayed in (it's $35,000 a night), but the slightly smaller suites, like the penthouse, Hakone and Sake suites, have all sorts of great amenities like separate media rooms, places for a personal sushi chef to set up, and of course VIP treatment at Nobu restaurant. But the regular rooms, like the Nobu deluxe king, are secretly some of the best deals on the Strip. The Rockwell Group’s 2022 rethink of the rooms inspired by \nkintsugi\n, the Japanese art of gold epoxy-veined pottery, gives them a warm, residential feel.They also have enormous baths, for those who love a big, fabulous bathroom. And you can get 24/7 Nobu in-room dining."", 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe bed is lovely, with Filo d\'Oro linens. It all feels super-luxe, but relaxing. You will likely not want to turn on the enormous, 55"" TV.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that find its way into your suitcase?\nLittle touches here are so nice, like the fact that you can order from Nobu anytime and the tea that\'s served on your arrival. But it\'s the technology you might be most impressed with. For one, you\'ll never find yourself stuck on the ""local"" elevator: A scanner reads your key before you get into the elevator and you choose your floor before you get in. It won\'t stop at other floors, which is both a security boon and a time-saver. My favorite of all secret amenities is the fact that there\'s a Nobu-exclusive spa menu at Qua, the massive spa in Caesars.', ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nFor relatively modest-sized rooms (remember, this is a retrofit of the old Centurion tower), the bathrooms are really large and the showers are made of sleek black Japanese tile. There are big rain shower heads and the kinds of traditional teak stools you'd find in a bathhouse. And the amenities are NaturaBisse (and smell amazing)."", 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-fi is included in the $52 resort fee.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nIf you\'ve ever dreamed of picking up a phone and having the\xa0\namazing food of Nobu\n\xa0delivered right to you, your time in the sun has arrived. Seriously, this menu is amazing and you absolutely should order in-room dining while you\'re here. It\'s easy enough to go to the restaurant downstairs, which is the only Nobu that serves breakfast. One of the biggest hits on the menu, which was served at the opening and is still hugely popular, is Nobu\'s ""bagel and lox,"" which is a breakfast cake of crispy rice with everything spice, tofu cream and salmon pastrami. But you can get everything from a classic Japanese breakfast to green tea waffles with applewood smoked bacon. Think of all of your favorite Nobu items, like the famous black cod miso, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and all the sushi you can eat: If you really want to get into the experience, though, order one of the bento boxes. The ""High Roller,"" which includes lobster, crab, wagyu, sushi and all the nice little extras, is $185. Bonus: You can even have the restaurant\'s specialty cocktails, like a lychee and elderflower martini, delivered to your room.', ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe dining staff is, of course, exceptional.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",2,"The Strip’s Ancient Rome–themed wonderland is anything but stuck in the past; its largest building block—the 1,181-room Palace Tower—which got a $100 million reno just a few years back, is testament to that fact. Those looking for a splurgy trip should go straight for the 29th-floor villa suites, which, like the grand villas in the Octavius and Augustus towers, are massive and full of great (and OTT) design details. Because Vegas is all about donning your new identity for a while, you can pick from villas with completely different aesthetics, from Ancient Greece to a formal northern European villa furnished in Biedermeier furniture, to neoclassical French Empire and English Regency, all with features like 24K gold-plated fixtures and hand-painted murals, private elevator entry, limo transport, and VIP check-in. Bacchanal continues to offer one of the most mind-blowing buffets in the world (it never ends and serves about 500 dishes at any one time), and if you feel like walking to the other end of the massive complex, you'll get to the Forum Shops, where the retail offerings are vast and there are even more places to dine. It’s truly a self-contained city.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThe best thing about arriving at the Augustus and Octavius tower rooms is that they have their own entrance, on Flamingo, far away from the crowds of the Strip. You can valet there and go right to registration, as opposed to the Forum and Julius towers (and even the hotel-within-hotel that is\xa0\nNobu\n), where you have to come into the chaotic main entrance. It's all light colors and modern lines in Augustus (no centurions taking selfies with margarita swilling tourists here!), and you won't even be close to a casino floor, so it feels very calm."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nThe travelers who are Augustus regulars know exactly what they want from the 4,000-room Roman extravaganza that is Caesars. Each tower is different, and Augustus is one of the newest constructions (and recently renovated). The rooms are spacious, and though the newer Octavius tower is considered to be an upgrade, it actually takes longer to walk to Octavius from the main entrance and the casino. Those who bypass Octavius for Augustus know this. They're generally well-informed frequent visitors to Vegas who either do business here or gamble here frequently. Where it can take a lot of time in other parts of the resort just to locate coffee, there's a Starbucks just off the lobby here and it all feels much better planned."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nCaesars is constantly renovating, and its largest tower—the Palace Tower (with 1,181 rooms) got a $100 million reno just a few years back.

Caesars seems to understand that it's important to be able to watch TV at all times, so there are flat panel screens that you can see from your jetted tub. Toiletries are branded with the spa (Qua) name, but aren't so remarkable that you'd care to hoard them."", ""Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nThe Wi-Fi was super fast and included in the price of the resort fee (which is pretty high, at $45 per night). The catch: I could only connect two devices. So if you're using the Wi-Fi for laptop and phone, your traveling companion will have to pay extra."", 'Food and drink\n\xa0Caesars’ restaurants, too, are updating. I love the fact that not everything is pricey here. You can walk to the Forum Shops and get to some good mainstream eats, as well as get very good food at the Forum Food Hall (DiFara Pizza, Bobby’s Burgers). Then splurge at Nobu, Mr. Chow, or Restaurant Guy Savoy.', ""Room service: Worth it?\nRoom service is all the standard items—big breakfasts, appetizers, salads, and all the expected entrees (salmon, chicken, a grilled NY strip). But Caesars has done something smart and let guests order from its Chinese restaurant Beijing Noodle No. 9 as well as pizzas from Di Fara. So you feel like you're getting takeout delivered right to your door. (Except that with the $10 delivery fee and the 18 percent included tip and taxes, this may be the highest charge attached to any in room dining in Vegas.) Except for the pizza (which is great) and the Chinese food (which is standard but a great idea), I'd consider skipping in-room dining and heading downstairs. Bacchanal Buffet is a short distance from Augustus Tower."", ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nI wouldn't necessarily award anything to the staff, but I would award something to the employees of the extremely busy Starbucks in the lobby!"", ""Anything stand out about other services and features?

Bacchanal Buffet continues to be one of the most mind-blowing buffets in the world (it never ends and serves about 500 dishes at any one time). If you're going to go to the spa, stay in Augustus Tower, which is the closest to Qua Baths & Spa. The additional benefit here is that you won't have to wander through a casino with wet hair and no makeup after you've been relaxing there. Caesars has more restaurants than you can shake a stick at, and if you feel like walking to the other end of the massive complex, you'll get to the Forum Shops, where the retail offerings are vast and there are even more places to dine.

As are the other casinos operated by Station Casino, it's known as a locals' casino, and gets tons of foot traffic.

When you walk across the long footbridge that spans the Bel-Air’s Swan Lake (yes, there are actual swans gliding around) as the larks chirp among the palms and bougainvillea, there’s a sense of the whole sprawling megalopolis melting into the Santa Monica foothills. The Bel-Air has long been a sanctuary, a pastel-hued, Mediterranean-influenced refuge for the likes of Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe. Old Hollywood credentials and tinkling fountains aside, the Bel-Air is no fusty heirloom. A 2012 revamp by New York–based designer Alexandra Champalimaud gave the place a very intentional but somehow apt mid-century brightness. Rooms—all creams, peaches, and ochres in the hotel’s Spanish Colonial style—now come with heated bathroom floors and private terraces with hot tubs and fire pits. Wolfgang Puck, who has been associated with the hotel for more than 30 years, continues to evolve the menu. An alcove overlooking the lake is the perfect setting for a 34-ounce prime porterhouse and a glass of bone-dry Champagne Henriot.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nAs downtown L.A. continues to take off, this classic Hollywood hideaway nods to the city's glamorous past with its extensive gardens, chic pool scene, and warm pink-walled spa. This is what it must feel like to be Hollywood royalty. Tucked away from the city in the hills of Bel-Air amid a 12-acre garden, the hotel is the very definition of exclusivity."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nThere's no denying that this hotel attracts a high-end clientele, people who want to stay somewhere that feels as close to a private estate as possible—where they can hole up and disappear if they so choose."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about the rooms.\nThe hotel has almost just as many suites (45) as it does guest rooms (58)—the smallest of which is still a pretty sizable 450 square feet. Designed by Alexandra Champalimaud, who also oversaw a full overhaul of the lobby and spa in 2012, the rooms are airy, with a tasteful and somewhat muted palette (brown, white, beige, gold). Feminine yet unfussy, these are definitely rooms you want to linger in and return to at the end of the day.', ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep.

The restaurant was also redone during the 2012 renovation by David Rockwell design.', 'Anything stand out?\nThe legendary Oak Bar is now just The Bar, which hosts live music every night and specializes in small-batch rye, scotch, bourbon, and whiskey. Lining the walls are large black-and-white images by Norman Seeff, who photographed greats like Ray Charles and The Rolling Stones. The iconic oval-shaped pool—heated to 82 degrees year-round—was once a horse-riding ring. Sunbathing guests can expect hourly treats (think chocolate-dipped bananas and fruit sorbet ""push pops"").', ""What was most memorable about your stay?\nThe location.

The palm trees, pink walls, and lush gardens of the Beverly Hills Hotel are as much a part of Hollywood iconography as the sign itself. The place is the site of legends: British Royals, Beatles, and Oscar winners have slept on its pillows, Elizabeth Taylor had six of her eight honeymoons here, and a renovation completed in 2015 brought all of that history up to date so it could remain the playground it's always been. Tip: Book your reservation at the Polo Lounge at the same time you book the room.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nChances are good that you have a mental image of the palm trees and lush gardens leading up to the “Pink Palace,” which is located just off Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Beverly Hills, and feels like a private estate tucked away in the hills. If not, you might greet the pink-and-green color palette, and the Dorothy Draper-designed banana leaf wallpaper, like a faded celebrity who you mistook for a high school classmate. Though steeped in legend—it's no wonder the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, John Wayne, and Henry Fonda all stayed there; or that Elizabeth Taylor took to the bungalows with six of her eight husbands, or that John Lennon and Yoko Ono hid out in a bungalow for a week; or that Charlie Chaplin, a frequent guest in the 1920s, returned in 1972 to accept an honorary Oscar, and Faye Dunaway stayed there after receiving her Academy Award for Network in 1977. It still manages to stay modern: Between 2012 and 2015, it had a four-phase renovation project of the lobby, Polo Lounge, pool cabanas, and all rooms and suites in the main building. And despite all of the much-needed updating, silver dollar pancakes at the Fountain Shop are served exactly as they always have for time immemorial."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nOver the last 100 years, it’s become a playground for the Hollywood elite, royalty from around the world, and business people—plus leisure travelers (including families), many of whom return year after year.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about the rooms.\nThere are 208 guest rooms, including 23 bungalows, which were restored under the guidance of Alexandra Champalimaud. Some of them take inspiration from former famous guests; for example, No. 22 honors Frank Sinatra with a desert aesthetic modeled after his Palm Springs home. Bungalow 5 is outfitted in colors from Elizabeth Taylor’s jewelry collection, including citrine and gold. (She spent six of her eight honeymoons in that suite.)', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nCustom bed linens are embroidered with the hotel crest.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar. Any worth a mention?\nMini-bars are stocked with “Gourmet” snacks for $14 (a tad much for gummy bears and cashews!) and “Comfort” snacks for $6 (Kit Kat, Snickers, etc)', 'Other in-room amenities: Every room and suite has high-tech panels to control light and temperature and oversized walk-in closets. A third have balconies, fireplaces, terraces, or patios.', 'There are in-room yoga and meditation menus. Complimentary wellness kits are offered in all suites, and include an instructional yoga DVD, mats, blocks, stretch bands, Buddha boards, massage balls, and therapeutic oils.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nLarge marble bathrooms have illuminated mirrors with built-in TVs, a shower and soaking tub. Bath amenities are made custom for the hotel by Natura. Shampoo is mimosa; conditioner is sage; bath gel is citron; the lotion is herbal ginseng; bath crystals are a hibiscus scent.', ""What do they have for food and drink?\nThe Polo Lounge is a quintessential LA power dining spot—assume there is a deal being made while you’re there. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, some out-of-towner getting engaged; it's a bit like Tavern on the Green that way. The Rat Pack used to drink here late night. There’s live jazz during Sunday brunch."", ""The Fountain Room Coffee Room is a 19-seat vintage soda fountain first opened in the 1940s. It serves breakfast all day, plus lunch and dinner—one of those classic diner menus. You can opt for casual al fresco poolside dining at the Cabana Café, which serves breakfast all day, fresh salads, wood-fired pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, and smoothies. There’s also a bar and communal table. Bar Nineteen12 is named after the year the hotel first opened. There's an indoor bar and a beautiful terrace overlooking the pool, gardens, and palm trees."", 'You can also try dishes from the “Perfection Just Happens” in-room menu, which has one dish from each of the Dorchester Collection hotels—including sister property \nHotel Bel-Air\n (Garden Vegetable Soup, inspired by one Wolfgang Puck’s mother used to make him in Austria).', 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nThe palm-tree lined pool, whose cabanas now boast the hotel’s iconic banana leaf Martinique wallpaper by CW Stockwell in a darling shade of millennial pink, is a snapshot of classic Hollywood. Duck your head underwater, heated year round to 82 degrees, and listen to tunes from classic films play while you swim. A few fun historic anecdotes: Katharine Hepburn once dove fully clothed into the pool after a tennis game; Raquel Welch and Robert Evans were discovered by Hollywood elite while lounging poolside; Leonard Bernstein came up with the idea for West Side Story in Cabana 3. The Beverly Hills Hotel Spa has a private check-in privacy, and four newly renovated treatment rooms adorned with soothing lapiz and gold hues, as well as steam showers and a mani/pedi salon that looks out over the citrus grove. Follow up your ayurvedic facial treatment with yoga in their sleek gym. To get the true 90210 experience, the hotel partners with Beverly Hills Car Rental so that guests can cruise around in a Lamborghini Huracan EVO, Rolls Royce Cullinan or Rolls Royce Ghost.

The West Hollywood EDITION,"Hot List, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",2,"Los Angeles may be the city of countless stars, but its Hollywood hotelscape, until fairly recently, had become a little faded. Among the handful of dazzling newcomers, including properties from 1 Hotel and Kimpton, here’s a place that warrants top billing. A collaborative project between Marriott and hotel alchemist Ian Schrager (the man behind Studio 54 and new-wave scene-setters the Paramount and Royalton), the Edition group has been landing around the world, from London to Shanghai and, earlier last year, Times Square. This latest, though—the first on the West Coast—is exceptional and marks Schrager's return to L.A. since opening the Mondrian here in the mid 1990s. Hidden in plain sight on the Boulevard behind a screen of specially planted trees, it brings a welcome blast of East Coast energy to the city along with pared-back interiors by minimalist designer John Pawson. It all feels ultra-modern but warm, with whitewashed larch and Technicolor pops such as the banana-yellow pool table, and all-white bedrooms that feel cooling rather than stark; the huge lobby resembles an Italian piazza, albeit one lined by canvases and with a oil-barrel mobile artwork by L.A. artist Sterling Ruby dangling above it. The rooftop bar and plant-shaded pool, meanwhile, draws a local crowd for its raw bar menu and astounding panoramic views to the Pacific and Hollywood Hills, and ground-floor restaurant Ardor takes a cue from California’s inventive vegetarian scene with a spiced-up, plant-forward menu (cauliflower cacio e pepe, whipped feta and beets). This is a hotel that’s helping reboot the L.A. scene, from a brand that understands the city.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention?\nIt's an immediate scene when you walk into the oversize lobby at the WeHo Edition, and would you expect anything less? Sky high ceilings, a super sexy bar, an incredible art collection, and an oversize pool table are all a part of the lively, social energy that pulse from the entrance at any hour."", ""What's the backstory?\nGetting an outpost of The Edition Hotel feels like a right of passage for a megapolis. The partnership between Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager and Marriott International now has hotels in \nNew York\n, Shanghai, \nMiami\n and \nLondon\n, and its Sunset Blvd location offers all the glam that they’re known for, and then some."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations.\nMinimalist British architect John Pawson teamed up with notoriously meticulous genius Schrager to outfit to outfit the 190 guest rooms and 50 suites with expansive outdoor terraces, modern decor, and ultra-luxe details that give an air of serenity compared to the scene below.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nChef John Fraser of Michelin-starred Nix restaurant skews heavily towards vegan and vegetarian for Ardor, the ground floor restaurant at Edition. The dining room is very Jungalow, with plenty of greenery to match it's flexitarian-friendly menu. Do not miss the plant-based takes on Italian classics like cauliflower cacio e pepe or the arugula farro risotto. As with any Angeleno hotel worth its salt, there's a solid rooftop bar with expansive views of the city right next to the pool, which makes a perfect place to watch the sunset."", ""How's the service?\n Smart and considerate."", 'What type of travelers will you find here?\nHollywood Jetset 2.0. Young and stylish, these citizens of the world have good taste and ample cash, and they know where to spend it.', ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in?\nSchraeger's Studio 54 pedigree fits right in on iconic Sunset Boulevard."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nThe street entrance is discreet, but it's easy to pass by."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\nYou don't want to miss out on the underground night club, Sunset, with a ceiling decked out in 30 oversized golden disco balls. If you feel like you missed your calling with 54, now is your chance."", 'Bottom line: Why are we choosing the Edition?\n Edition is a step above the tired hotels of WeHo, with a chic cosmopolitan feel and common areas to boot.']","9040 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90069, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/los-angeles/the-west-hollywood-edition,https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/laxeb-the-west-hollywood-edition/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"The Beverly Wilshire is as close to a European grand dame as you'll find in L.A.—with impeccable service to match. It was good enough for Elvis and the British Royal Family, and exists in triumphant opposition to the informal, minimal lobbies sprouting up across the city. Regular guests love the views of Rodeo Drive and Hollywood Hills and the pool, which was based on Sophia Loren's Tuscan villa. And because this is L.A., the scene here wouldn't be complete without somewhere to eat: There's The Blvd, an all-day spot, and the Michelin-starred CUT by Wolfgang Puck, a modern-day steakhouse designed by architect Richard Meier. If you're looking for classic luxury, look no further. ","['Why book?\n\xa0A historic and glitzy landmark, this hotel—featured in movies like\xa0\nPretty Woman\n and\xa0\nClueless\n—epitomizes Beverly Hills and oozes elegance.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0From the moment you enter the marble lobby, with its massive chandelier dripping with Swarovski crystals, you can’t help but feel a little bit iconic. You even get that feeling when you’re still outside, eyeing the grand Renaissance Revival-style building and its striped bubble awnings, pulling up to the wrought iron gates of the porte-cochére for valet—where a Lamborghini or Ferrari might be parked. You’ll likely see older couples in Dior, Ralph Lauren, and Armani, who might just be in for dinner at Cut; families with well-groomed children checking in; plus tourists snapping photos in the lobby or on the red benches in the original gold elevators (replicating a classic scene from\xa0\nPretty Woman\n).', ""The backstory\n\xa0Opened in 1928, when Beverly Hills had less than 1,000 residents, the hotel launched with a massive New Year’s Eve party and hasn’t slowed down since. The hotel helped launch the now-iconic neighborhood, observing the transformation of Rodeo Drive into a shopping mecca in the 1970s and countless \nHollywood\n films being shot here. It became a Four Seasons in 1992, and has housed countless celebrities and dignitaries, from Al Pacino to Barack Obama to the Dalai Lama, and Elvis Presley and Warren Beatty even lived here for several years. In 1971, the 14-story Beverly Wing was built and connected to the original Wilshire Wing via a cobblestoned entryway that's lined with gaslight lanterns—all imported from Edinburgh. The hallway behind the elevators serves as a mini museum, complete with a historical timeline and glass vitrine with photographs, documents, and other objects from the hotel’s storied history."", 'The rooms\n\xa0The hotel recently completed a renovation of all 395 of its rooms, giving them a more balanced vibe of fresh California style with Old Hollywood glamour courtesy of David Collins Studio. Think light gray walls and furnishings, marble side tables, curved Art Deco-inspired lighting, botanical artwork, and marble bathrooms. You won’t be surprised by any of the design choices, which mostly feel safe, but also elegant and luxe. Between the two wings, there are plenty of room options, with various sizes and layouts to satisfy almost any traveler, from couples to families. And if you’re splurging, you’ll find one of the largest penthouses in all of Los Angeles and the largest in Beverly Hills, plus a presidential suite in each wing—Kara Smith of KES Studio redesigned the six specialty suites, which are a bit more whimsical.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0The food here is upscale with a side of California classic. The hotel is home to the flagship location of Wolfgang Puck’s steakhouse Cut, and the man himself is often in the kitchen or visiting tables—but either way you can’t miss the massive Martin Schoeller photograph of him hanging over the hostess desk. Across the hall is the more casual Cut Lounge, which is a cocktail bar with small bites. On the opposite end of the lobby is the street-facing The Blvd, which is open all day and always has a buzzing patio in nice weather. Diners munch on California-fresh dishes like whole-roasted branzino with chermoula, Wagyu beef yakitori, and lobster pappardelle, along with a caviar menu.', 'The spa\n\xa0The Forbes Five Star spa is deceptively large, with 13 plush treatment rooms, a relaxation room, and a wet room with a eucalyptus steam room, sauna, ice fountain, and experience shower. It’s the kind of that’s-so-Hollywood place where there’s state-of-the-art, technologically inclined facials and body treatments like a LightStim LED session and cryotherapy, alongside more analog treatments like the\xa0Holistic Detox Body Treatment, which includes a dry brushing, body oil and scrub application, full body massage, and mini facial using all-natural Seed to Skin products from Tuscany. Whichever you choose, relaxation and rejuvenation is not far away.', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0Beverly Hills is its own\xa05.71-square-mile city, and the reputation you’ve seen on TV or heard about is pretty accurate—star-studded, glamorous, flashy, luxe, and expensive. For high-end, bend-over-backwards service, designer shopping, perfectly manicured parks, and plenty of classic photo opps, Beverly Hills can’t be beat. And, it’s easy to get to both the east and west sides of Los Angeles, making it an ideal location to rest your head if you enjoy timeless elegance instead of the trend du jour.', 'The service\n\xa0Service here is top notch, with the front desk and concierge bending over backwards to make\xa0guests happy. Valet is at your beck and call and switching dinner reservations or nabbing hard-to-get ones are a non-issue. However, it is an extremely busy hotel so sometimes the phone rings more than a few times before the front desk answers. When we stayed, we asked to switch from a suite with two doubles to one with a king bed and pullout couch, which was accomplished swiftly and seamlessly thanks to a team of attentive bellmen and housekeeping, who made up the couch quickly and neatly for our already-sleepy son.', 'For families\n\xa0Like all Four Seasons, families are well cared for here, with kids enjoying special welcome gifts and extra attention. While there is no kids club, all the amenities and gear you can think of (cribs, diaper genies, baby shampoo and soap, etc.) come standard. There are also plenty of large rooms and suites of various layouts to easily accommodate most families, and the Blvd restaurant has a kids menu and coloring supplies.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0This is an older hotel but there have been efforts to upgrade accessibility. For example, at the end of 2022 they were in the process of adding ramps on the\xa0porte-cochére entrance, which has a few steps. However, it’s a large hotel with two separate buildings to navigate. To note: the hallways in the original Wilshire Wing are extremely wide (originally to accommodate travelers’ large trunks) and might be more accommodating to those with mobility issues.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0Don’t miss\xa0the chic Mediterranean-style outdoor pool, which is modeled after the one at Sofia Loren’s private villa in Italy. Tucked away on a secluded terrace, it has the requisite Beverly Hills palm trees, plus Italian lemon trees, glittering turquoise tiles, cabanas, and a poolside cafe.']","9500 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, California 90212, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/united-states/beverly-hills/beverly-wilshire-beverly-hills-a-four-seasons-hotel,http://www.fourseasons.com/beverlywilshire/

Cara Hotel,"Hot List, 2021.",2,"This tranquil newcomer’s location on a ho-hum stretch in LA's Los Feliz makes passing through its olive-and-palm-tree-lined courtyard all the more delightful. The name Cara means “friend” in Gaelic, and the idea of warm, convivial hospitality is played up throughout its 60 breezy rooms. The lobby’s custom crown molding, pearlescent plastered walls, and sky-high cove ceilings carry an Old World grandeur that’s mellowed by modern local artwork and plenty of honeyed SoCal sunlight. The outdoor restaurant is perfect for Angelenos’ favorite pastime—alfresco cocktailing— with seating that spills out around a long reflecting pool, creating the feeling of a Moroccan riad. Though the Cara was once a 1950s motel, this is far from the typical flip. The down-to-the-studs renovation expanded rooms to include courtyard- facing balconies, and the decor eschews midcentury nostalgia for a strict shades-of-white approach that amplifies the texture, shape, and quality of the materials: nubby upholstered headboards, crisp linens, matte ceramic lamps. The only real accents come from the black of the leaded windows and curlicue wrought iron. The overall result is an elegant, restful retreat in a town that usually goes all in on drama.","['Why book?\n Ultra-chic but skips the pretense, this design hotel is equally as appealing for a weekend escape, staycation or pied a terre for professionals in town for work.', 'Set the scene:\n Situated on stretch of boulevard smack dab between Los Feliz and Thai Town, the Cara Hotel couldn’t have picked a more unassuming location. But pass through the courtyard lined with centuries old olive trees, through the oversize arched doorway, and you’ll step into an urban oasis that’s equally a draw for out-of-towners as it is locals looking to escape the rush of \nLA\n.', 'The backstory:\n The Cara is the first of a handful of SoCal properties for the team spearheaded by restaurateur-turned-hotelier Dean McKillen. Though known locally for his famous West Hollywood bar Laurel Hardware, McKillen is hardly unfamiliar with the hotel world; his family built the iconic Maybourne Hotel Group.', 'The rooms:\n Though the Cara was once a 1950s motel, this is far from the typical flip. The down-to-the-studs renovation expanded rooms to include private courtyard balconies, whose eye-pleasing natural linens and earthy finishes bring the outside in. The hotel’s airy lobby, with its custom crown molding, pearlescent Venetian plastered walls, and sky high high arched ceilings is the perfect backdrop for a Zoom call at your incredibly enviable remote office.', 'Food and drink:\n Cara’s outdoor restaurant is perfectly suited for LA’s most popular competitive sport—al fresco cocktailing—with seating surrounding a swimming pool-sized water feature that lends the feel of a Moroccan riad. Executive Chef Patrick Florendo is as genius with his handmade pastas as he is with meats smoked in a Big Green Egg out back. Do not to miss out on his vibrant lemon pasta made with top notch parm and first press olive oil—a deceivingly simple dish that will transport you right to the \nAmalfi\n in springtime. And seeing as the Cara has Irish management, the humble potato is taken to new heights in all its forms, from kale colcannon to the simple breakfast potato, these spuds are a must order for carb lovers, especially when served alongside a perfectly prepared rack of Aussie lamb.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n Cara’s Los Feliz adjacency means that you can just as easily rise early for a hike in \nGriffith Park\n as you can peruse the shelves at Skylight Books or hop over to Big Bar for cocktails, if you can tear yourself from the beautiful house bar.', 'The service:\n The name Cara means “friend"" in Gaelic, and the team is playing up the notion of warm Irish hospitality. And, being a smaller boutique operation, it seems that everyone knows your name. Don’t be surprised if someone remembers your coffee order in the morning, too, or if your pooch is gifted local treats as part of your welcome.', 'Eco effort:\n There’s a big push to use local makers, sustainable farmers, natural winemakers, and crafters, as well as the local gallery of ceramicist and artist John Whigmor.', 'Accessibility:\n ADA rooms are available on the ground level of the property.']","1730 N Western Ave, Los Angeles, California 90027",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/los-angeles/cara-hotel,https://www.carahotel.com/
Kimpton La Peer Hotel,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2018. Readers' Choice Awards, 2020.",2,"This West Hollywood hangout confirms that boutique group Kimpton has the design chops to rival the NoMads and Firmdales of the hotel world. In large part that is down to the bold aesthetic of the interiors by Gulla Jónsdóttir, a West Hollywood resident who channeled the lava fields and waterfalls of her native Iceland with a frosty grey-and-black palette in the guest rooms and lobby, with leather walls, bulbous light fixtures, and a collection of Saba sofas. Bright blooms from star florist Eric Buterbaugh undercut the heaviness of it all. Things perk up outdoors, where a sun-flooded bar that’s already a hit with the cool kids of West Hollywood wraps around the small swimming pool. Artworks from graffiti pieces by Retna to a topographical installation of the city are on display behind the front desk. Even the walls of the elevator are covered in floral murals by Japanese graphic artist and Apple collaborator Kahori Maki. Staff may let you ride it all the way to the top to peek at Jónsdóttir’s nature-inspired wood, metal and stone furniture in the 1,400-square-foot penthouse. As West Hollywood continues its reinvention as a design district, Kimpton La Peer is a worthy anchor of it all. ","[""Set the scene.\nKimpton's opening is set in West Hollywood’s Design District—and it fits right in. L.A.-based Icelandic designer Gulla Jónsdóttir was enlisted to create the stylish interiors, and the result is a mix of natural materials (concrete, leather walls, white oak flooring) and custom furnishings, such as six-foot light sconces in the lobby. She also collaborated with artists, poets and photographers, personally selecting each work on display. Outside, olive trees and a vertical garden make the pool feel secluded and intimate."", 'What’s the story?\nThe latest opening from the California-based Kimpton outfit continues the boutique group’s clever appropriation of original, keen-minded architects and designers, who are set to work in some striking locations—Savannah, \nSouth Beach\n, \nAmsterdam\n. It never feels as if you’re being hosted by a large hotel group.', ""What can we expect in our room?\nStandard rooms are somewhat small but still manage to feel bright and airy, in shades of grey and white with bronze and wood touches. There's also a complimentary mini bar and an in-room bottle service for made-to-order craft cocktails. The fourth-floor penthouse is used to showcase pieces from Jónsdóttir's own furniture collection."", 'How about the food and drink?\nThe Eastern Med meets SoCal at Ladyhawk by Charbel Hayek, where the menu offers sharable plates tabouleh, fattoush salad, half chicken with whipped toum, and charred veggies, all which pair perfectly with spice-forward cocktails. For breakfast and lighter fare, there’s the Courtyard Bar, which serves up the ubiquitous avo toast accompanied with juices and smoothies by Little West.', 'Who comes here?\nDesign-forward guests in creative fields, all feeling right at home.', 'How does it fit into the neighborhood?\nThis is right where you want to be in L.A.’s boho Design District, within walking distance of art galleries, cool coffee shops, and some top-notch restaurants—you could start at the homeware shops on Melrose Avenue, keep an eye out for graffiti murals, then drop into Craig’s for a vegan chicken parmigiana and a Skinny Amiga cocktail (tequila, lime, agave and pomegranate).', 'Anything else we should know about?\nOpen-air yoga classes are hosted on the rooftop; in-room JadeYoga mats make it easy to work out in private. There’s no in-house spa, but the hotel has a partnership with the Ole Henriksen spa at the nearby Sunset Plaza. Guests can book in-room services.', 'Bottom line: Why are choosing Kimpton La Peer?\nFor the feeling of a high-design hotel with all the Kimpton bells and whistles.']","627 N La Peer Dr, Los Angeles, California 90069, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/los-angeles/kimpton-la-peer,https://www.lapeerhotel.com/

Palihotel Culver City,,2,"Boutique brand Palisociety is quietly creating a mini empire of pretty patterns and breezy living room-style salons around greater L.A., having opened four hotels with less than 50 rooms from Santa Monica to West Hollywood in the past decade (a fifth arrives soon). Culver City, a Westside neighborhood of old film studios that’s having a creative renaissance, marks Pali’s entry into an emerging Los Angeles scene. The hotel rises above a residential corner with walls painted like the brand’s signature wallpaper, topped with a neon sign. Something about the design, which lands on the smarter side of kitsch, with heavy woods, flannel blankets, and groovy floral prints, recalls the classic, ‘60s Frankie Avalon film Beach Blanket Bingo. Yet there are no teen idols cutting a rug in Pali’s indigo-blue outdoor bar. Instead the hotel is drawing in the cool kids from Silver Lake who have finally started taking Culver City seriously and who are likely to be discussing the latest detox over mushroom sandwiches and salad Niçoise at its Simonette restaurant. As the Los Angeles hotel landscape is starting to mature quickly, Pali’s fun, young vibe is a refreshing counterpoint that taps into the SoCal spirit in a way big-wig arrivals just can’t. ","[""Set the scene.\nAlthough the hotel is tucked away on a side street in Culver City, just off the buzzy main drag, there’s no missing it. It’s painted a seriously bright, saturated turquoise-meets-teal blue, except, that is, for the one side that’s entirely covered in a botanical mural that calls to mind Osborne and Little floral wallpaper. Bold, indeed, but in this part of town (Culver City was the birthplace of the movie industry), a little dazzle works well. The building’s '20s façade, with its Deco signage, street numbers and light fixtures, feels both Parisian and classic Hollywood; the lobby has vintage artwork, ceramic tiled floors, and black-and-white striped wallpaper, and yet this isn’t a period property in the way Wes Anderson’s films aren’t period films. The pastiche of references makes it feel totally fresh and modern."", 'What’s the story behind it?\nAs the sign says, this used to be the West Side Hotel, but before that it was the Washington Hotel, which opened in the 1920s and was rumored to have been a favorite of Joan Crawford. A member of the Palisociety group, owned by the sharp-suited, New Jersey-born Avi Brosh, the Culver City location is sister hotel to three other Palihotels in the city.', 'What can we expect from the rooms?\nThere are rooms with either one king or two twins across the hotel’s four floors—some ground-level rooms have doors that open onto a terrace while those on higher floors have views of the courtyard garden. The overall feel is very bright and airy; there’s almost a \nShutters on the Beach\n vibe—coastal, with white walls, lots of wood, and, yes, painted wooden shutters. Rooms are a real mix of colors, patterns, and textures: Stuffed chairs are upholstered in floral fabrics, plaid camp blankets are folded on the beds alongside striped throw pillows and hits of baby blue or forest green. There are nods to the 1950s, such as the wooden headboards with built-in bedside tables that house old-school alarm clocks (very West Coast Cali meets Danish mid-century), pin-up prints, and Bakelite rotary telephones, but modern touches too (rain showers, large wall-mounted TVs, fully stocked mini bars, and free wifi).', 'How about the food and drink?\nSimonette\n, on the ground floor, is the hotel’s hopping, very charming French-style bistro. It’s open all day and is equally good for a quick croissant and an espresso or a breakfast cocotte in the morning as it is for moules-frite and a glass of rosé for lunch or dinner. Dishes are classic and pretty straight-forward, yet this is California, so you know the ingredients in that Niçoise salad are going to amp things up. The Simonette Bar mixes some of the most technical craft cocktails in town, such as the Right Brigade (Ford’s Gin, Campari, white vermouth and amontillado sherry, filtered through coffee).', 'Anything to say about the service?\nFantastic across the board. The staff were incredibly hard working—they do show off a lot of tattoo ink and Breton stripes, but are far from dawdling hipsters. The hotel and the bar and restaurant can be busy but the staff can handle it; they’re experienced players.', 'Who comes here?\nThe guests are a real mix—hipsters on vacation, young families, older, well-dressed couples in their 50s and 60s. Apple has an office nearby where its original content operations are housed, so there are visiting creative types; the Sony Pictures Studio is in walking distance, so there’s a fair share of industry types milling about.', ""How does it fit into the neighborhood?\nCulver City is developing fast and you can feel the westside cool of Venice expanding east into the area. It’s a nice mid-point location between the beach and downtown, two parts of Los Angeles that you’ll likely want to explore. There are great restaurants, like \nDestroyer\n, and really good shopping in the area. And there's the Helms Bakery District, a 1930s bread factory turned retail complex that’s well worth spending a morning in—Arcana Books is here, which has some fantastic photographic and art titles, and HD Buttercup, a warehouse-sized furniture store that has reclaimed pieces and new designs that you’ll do the math on shipping home."", 'Worth it?\nAbsolutely worth investigating even if only for a night.']","3927 Van Buren Pl., Culver City, California 90232, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/culver-city/culver-city/palihotel-culver-city,https://www.palisociety.com/hotels/culver-city/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Although it spans just under two square miles, the little city of West Hollywood (WeHo) is, like much of Los Angeles County, having a big hotel moment. What makes the arrival of 1 Hotel West Hollywood so special—in a wave of openings that includes the Edition’s first West Coast property and the Pendry—is its sharp focus on sustainability. Interior design star Tony Machado used elements of biophilic design (incorporating the natural world—materials, light, vegetation, views—into a built space) by adding greenery to every corner imaginable: a hanging garden at the entrance; a moss-covered wall that imitates the famed Hollywood sign; huge stone planters scattered around the lobby; and no less than three potted plants per bedroom. And almost everything—the flooring, the keys, the enormous sculpted tree-trunk reception desk—is made of reclaimed wood (around 72 tonnes of pine and olive trees downed during storms), while carpets are fashioned from repurposed ocean plastics. The effect of these materials and all the sunshine streaming in from enormous windows is a blurring of the inside and outside and an undeniable sense of wellbeing. The actual outdoor spaces—the rooftop pool and bar—have views of downtown and Laurel Canyon and, on a very clear day, all the way to the beach, while a 5,000 square-foot garden is filled with native plants. It feels like a small miracle that this spacious, verdant retreat exists on buzzing Sunset Boulevard.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention?\nIt'll take a second for your Uber to find the right pull-in for the 1 Hotel: It's on a busy Sunset Boulevard corner, and its concrete exterior decorated with sprawling lush plants are easy to miss compared to the surrounding sparkling billboards. It makes sense then that you feel as if you've stepped far from \nL.A.\n when you walk into the lower-level lobby, with exposed wood beams on the ceiling, natural-toned fabrics on the couches and chairs and the lobby bar, and, yes, even more plants. (Most of the timber, from the ceiling beams to the benches to the planters was felled by Angel City Lumber in a 26-mile radius of the hotel.)"", ""What's the story behind the space?\nBesides good looks, the hotel's natural, leafy decor serves a greater purpose. (Be sure to check out the petrified moss Hollywood sign mural.) The WeHo location is \n1 Hotel's first West Coast outpost\n—and it maintains all of the brand's sustainable initiatives. It's a floor-to-roof mission: from the carpets made of repurposed ocean plastics up to the chef's rooftop garden of herbs and veggies. Recycled materials abound, including items as small as hangers and room keys."", ""How about the room itself—given the choice, what should we book?\nI would recommend any of the Skyline rooms for the view alone or splash out on the 1,297-square-foot Panoramic Two-Bedroom suite, which offers views of both the skyline and the eight-story rope art between the hotel's two towers."", ""I booked into a Skyline King and, boy, did it have a great view of downtown L.A. With floor-to-ceiling windows, fronted by a comfy natural fiber couch, I barely wanted to leave my room. The wood-heavy decor extended into the space, too, with a wooden headboard, bench that I used as a luggage rack, and large armoire with hanging space and shelves (and a pair of complimentary cream socks to add to the cozy, slightly hygge vibe). As with all 1 Hotel rooms, mine had plants, this time hung above the bed. I'm still trying to figure out where I can find the floor mirror to install in my own home."", 'The bathrooms were modern with a counter free of tchotchkes and mini toiletries. Instead, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and the like are in less wasteful large, refillable bottles.', ""Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nThe Wi-Fi is free and works well. Don't believe me? Visit the lobby area, with its couches, armchairs, and bar area in the middle of the day, and you'll find plenty of Angelenos diligently taking advantage of the service, taking meetings and writing their next screenplays."", ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nYou have four options when you're here: the main 1 Kitchen by Top Chef Chris Crary, the lobby bar Juniper, the lunch-friendly Alice, and then Harriet's Rooftop, an indoor-outdoor joint with panoramic views of the city. You'll likely eat at 1 Kitchen the most (it's where breakfast is served each morning, which isn't included in your room rate), but don't miss out on the scene—and view—at Harriet's during your stay."", ""And how was the service?\n It was seamless and friendly, from the front desk for bag drop-off before our rooms were ready and check-in to the clerks at the hotel's chic gift shop. 1 Hotel also uses its app for most communication, in-room dining, and check-out, which, with a few taps was complete and we could whisk out the door to LAX."", ""What about the neighborhood? Is there much to do nearby?\nI was zipping all over the place on this trip, from Los Feliz to downtown to Bel-Air and back. Sure, it was an Uber drive to get anywhere I needed to go—but it's L.A., so being smack in the middle of West Hollywood meant it wasn't \nthat\n long of a drive, even with traffic."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\nTwo things: First, if you're keen on staying active while staying here, you have plenty of options. There are complimentary classes in the gym, trainers you can book, and even pet-friendly free canyon runs. Second, the hotel prioritizes accessibility, evident in the adaptive lift at the rooftop pool and roll-in showers. Many of the rooms are accessible on their own, but if this is a concern for you, call ahead so you get put it one that's best fit for your needs."", ""Bottom line: Worth it?\nYou can travel sustainably without even noticing you're doing it.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",2,"Piercing the blue Californian skies on Sunset Boulevard, this elegant Art Deco tower has long been a landmark of the city, home to Hollywood greats since its arrival in 1931, courtesy of architect Leland A. Bryant. In those days it was Clark Gable and Greta Garbo, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner—and John Wayne, who apparently kept a cow on his balcony to ensure fresh milk for his coffee. Now it’s shiny again after a multi-million-dollar renovation, and 21st-century stars are coming here just for a night or to grab a drink at the see-and-be-seen Tower Bar on the notorious Sunset Strip. The maître d’ discreetly juggles regular guests such as Jennifer Aniston with those who prefer dim lighting or need private corners for tête-à-têtes, while the bottom of the menu firmly reads: ""No photographs. No phone calls."" The spicy tuna tartare is nearly everyone’s favorite; the seared scallops with black leek and truffle sauce a close second. The 81 bedrooms are done up in dusty pinks and browns with dazzling bathrooms clad in metallic gold wallpaper designed by fashion illustrator Donald Robertson, and there’s a Joanna Vargas spa for those red-carpet moments. The newly refreshed outdoor terrace overlooking the small but beautiful pool is one of the loveliest spots—in a city with a strong alfresco game—for a breakfast of mashed avocado on sourdough with poached eggs, or simply to relax for an hour or so, taking in the spectacular views of L.A. and basking in that brilliant golden sunshine.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nThis Art Deco concoction rises above the palm trees of central Hollywood with a rooftop pool and sweeping city views.\xa0The 15-floor Art Deco tower first opened as an apartment building in 1929, and former residents include Howard Hughes, John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Frank Sinatra. In 2004, New York-based hotelier and restaurateur Jeff Klein bought and transformed what had become a run-down hotel, putting it back on the map. Chances are good you'll spot a celeb or two, as well as deal-making movie studio execs eating avocado toast at the poolside restaurant, The Terrace."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nExpect to see a mix of business and leisure travelers, mostly in the creative fields, from film to fashion, as well as local junior agents in Tod's taking morning calls and meetings in the public spaces."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about the rooms.\nAmong the 81 rooms and suites, there are 12 different types (from moderate queen up to the penthouse), but each has floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the city.

Warm, fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies at turndown are reason enough to hole up come evening.', ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nYou'll want to linger in the limestone bathrooms, which have floor-to-ceiling windows and either deep soaking tubs or stand-alone showers."", 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-Fi is free, and there are on-demand movies and iPhone stations in each room as well.', ""What do we have for food and drink?\nIf you're staying at the hotel, you'll want to tuck in at night to a burger or New York strip steak at the ground-floor, wood-paneled Tower Bar and Restaurant, housed inside Bugsy Siegel's old apartment.

Soho Warehouse,"Hot List, 2020.",1,"Nick Jones’s members’ clubs have become a litmus test for an area’s cool. And while the other Soho Houses around Los Angeles are in hipper-than-thou Malibu and sceney West Hollywood, this iteration—a seven-story hotel and private club inside a huge early-1900s warehouse—plumped for a still gritty but rapidly gentrifying corner in Downtown’s Arts District with plenty of space to play: a rooftop pool, three restaurants and bars, and the huge two-floor gym (this is LA). Bedrooms have an intentionally homey, vaguely '70s feel with ceramic lights and plenty of plants, nodding to a time when the building was used as a recording studio. In keeping with the neighborhood—powerhouse gallery Hauser & Wirth and other indie outfits are nearby—there’s art everywhere, from the loading-dock-entrance mural by Shepard Fairey to a huge acrylic number up on the roof by LA-based Australian Paul Davies and pool chairs covered in a custom print by local illustrator Ethan Lipsitz. Even graffiti tags from the days when the warehouse lay abandoned are preserved. For those who thought Soho House was (whisper it) losing its cred, this is a sneakers-and-skateboard example that it still has its finger firmly on the pulse.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention?\nDrawing inspiration from the Angeleno artists' community that set the scene for Downtown LA, \nSoHo Warehouse\n puts a major emphasis on the art displayed, with pieces from names like Fairey, Brian Bress, and more."", ""What's the backstory?\nThe SoHo House has become the gold standard when it comes to exclusive, modern day members only clubs, and this is their first hotel in the London-based brand's West Coast portfolio, which also includes LA locations in West Hollywood and Malibu."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations.\nThe 48-room property, inspired by the deco period, has options ranging from Cosy to Medium, Big and Large, with the latter boasting soaking tubs, sky high ceilings and room to entertain. Each has a very home-away-from-home feel, with jewel tones, and warm velvet accents that ease the eye after a day's work."", ""Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nThat's kind of the wrong question. There's a steep membership fee just to be able to stay here. But you don't pay for the Wi-Fi per se."", ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe bar/restaurant called House Kitchen is located on the lush rooftop terrace, and includes the greatest hits from the other SoHo properties, with a menu that's focussed on elevated American comfort food like burgers, mac n cheese, and wood-fired pizzas."", ""And the service?\n Service is thoughtful and high touch, and you'll feel just as important as any of the A-Listers that make this space their own."", ""What type of travelers will you find here?\nUnassuming elite. There's a suggested no-suit rule at SoHo, and everyone seems impossibly cool and equally as important. You just never know who you might be rubbing elbows with."", 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\nWith the emphasis on art and the nods to the local Arts District history, this definitely fits into what Downtown LA has been developed into as late, with other hotels like\xa0Per La, Proper, and the\xa0\nHoxton\n\xa0also opening within recent years.', ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\nYou don't want to miss out on the opportunity to utilize your access to the members-only Soho Warehouse public spaces, typically reserved for members only. And don't skip on the gym, in and of itself a design and art haven worth noting."", ""Bottom line: Worth it?\n Absolutely, a small price to pay to be in the thick of one of the city's most exciting neighborhoods, and with the access to the club, it's well worth the price.""]","1000 S Santa Fe Ave., Los Angeles, California 90021, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/los-angeles/soho-warehouse,http://www.sohowarehouse.com/

Hotel Per La,"Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"This hotel is the third act for the beautifully preserved Giannini building in downtown Los Angeles, but it may be the most meaningful one yet. Built in 1922 as the Bank of Italy in an ornate Neoclassical style, the building later found fame after years of neglect as The Nomad Los Angeles. When the pandemic shut down the world, the building went dark once more. Now after an ownership and management change, the hotel has begun anew as Hotel Per La, Italian for “for the,” which was inspired by the building’s original use as the bank for the people. That “for the people” feeling begins at the new entrance on Olive Street where guests walk through a mirrored tunnel—an obvious Instagram backdrop—but it also serves as an appreciation for guests. It says both “Welcome to Los Angeles” and “Wow, look at you.” The 241 guest rooms and suites have kept the thoughtfully decorated apartment style that was put in place by Jacques Garcia with soft beds, antique knick-knacks, and a mix of vintage and current photography. Yet up on the roof is where Hotel Per La shines, quite literally when the sun engulfs the pool deck and bar, encouraging guests to relax however they want.

Yet when the pandemic shut down the world, the NoMad shut down too. Thankfully in September 2022, it was revived as Hotel Per LA, a name that pays credence to the building’s humble mission to serve as a bank for the people.

Each room also has, on average, 14 photographs, all different sizes but artfully arranged and which juxtapose historic scenes from Italy and modern ones from Los Angeles. The hotel has several suites with very generous living spaces, which are ideal for longer stays. There are also a handful of patio rooms with doors that open out to a small, private courtyard, making these a clever option for a group of friends or a family gathering—simply open up your door and get together in the courtyard.

Yet this is not a fussy space by any means. Despite the cavernous feeling of the lobby, the vibe is California comfortable with white cloth-covered chairs and close-together tables. Chef Courtney Van Dyke has blended her experience from high-end luxury hotels in New York and her hometown of Los Angeles to create a menu with Italian influence but done in a decidedly West Coast manner. Her take on bucatini carbonara, made with spam and topped with nori strips, is a revelation for anyone who loves both carbonara and musubi. Another stellar place to hang out at Hotel Per La is Bar Clara, the rooftop pool and bar which is anchored by a fierce-looking gargoyle fireplace. Here guests can dine on both small and substantial plates during the day and sip clever cocktails at night. While the rooftop pool is a must on a hot day, you’ll want to cozy up next to the gargoyle when the sun goes down. For coffee and snacks throughout the morning, there’s Café Ora, just off the lobby, which also serves wine and gelato in the afternoons.', 'The spa', 'There is no spa but the hotel does have a small 24-hour fitness center with cardio machines and free weights.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Most visitors to downtown Los Angeles head to the L.A. Live complex with its sports arena, Grammy museum, and entertainment district. Hotel Per La is several blocks north of that, still within walking distance but not quite in the mix of it all. Which is a good thing. Instead, the hotel is closer to Pershing Square park, the Grand Central Market (a historic food hall), and more cultural spots like The Broad Museum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Some of downtown’s best restaurants are also within walking distance of Hotel Per La. But remember, this is downtown. The more popular LA landmarks like the beach, Hollywood and Beverly Hills aren’t exactly close by.', 'The service', 'Friendly and happy, especially at the restaurant and the bars. Hotel Per La isn’t white-glove luxury service but staffers are eager to help with your luggage and give you some suggestions for the area or how to plan your day.', 'Eco effort', 'Hotel Per La does its part to be sustainable and eco-minded, as all businesses in California and Los Angeles are expected to do.', 'Accessibility', 'Yes, the hotel has ADA compliant guest rooms and elevators. Guests can email\xa0frontdesk@hotelperla.com for more information.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'There’s one very large artifact of the building’s history that guests will not want to miss—it’s the giant bank vault which now serves as the restrooms in the basement floor below the lobby.

The breezy lobby bar has been redone with mid century modern furniture and brassy regency touches, giving the space a youthful feel. A diminutive Tokyo-style sushi bar located at the entrance gives the property even more ground floor appeal.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nIt’s a diverse mix of business travelers, families, and locals socializing in the pool or lobby bar during happy hour—many of whom have their pooch in tow. (The property is incredibly dog friendly.)', 'The good stuff: Tell us about the rooms.\nThe hotel is made up of multiple buildings, including the modern and renovated 10-story Ocean Tower.

Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2017.",2,"The Sheraton Maui is a sprawling resort on the northern stretch of Kaanapali, but its entrance is very low-key. The breezy lobby is an open-air one, and out the back are great views of the historic Black Rock. Kaanapali is home to several big hotel resorts like Westin, Hyatt, and Marriott. All are fairly crowded and none feel particularly local; the Sheraton, however, being at Black Rock, feels a little different. Its location also means that it has excellent snorkeling. This laid-back resort has been modified since COVID-19, meaning reservations are required for nearly all services, from pool and beach chairs, to spa and fitness, and of course, dining. The resort’s three restaurants are open, two of which have outside seating, although buffets and in-room dining are no longer available. ","['What was your first impression?\nThe Sheraton Maui is a sprawling resort on the northern stretch of Kaanapali, but its entrance is very low-key. The breezy lobby is an open-air one, and out the back are great views of historic Black Rock. Check-in happens at a small front desk on the left; concierges and tour operators occupy smaller desks elsewhere in the lobby. It’s nothing jaw-dropping to look at, but it’s pleasant enough.', ""What's the backstory?\nIn 1963, this Sheraton was the second resort to open on the island. On opening day, it held a cliff-diving ceremony off Black Rock to honor Kahekili, Maui’s last ruler before King Kamehameha united the Hawaiian islands. That cliff-diving ceremony has happened every evening since. Today the Sheraton is part of Marriott’s huge collection of hotels and resorts. So if you’ve got Marriott Bonvoy points to burn, you can do so here."", 'How are the rooms?\nThe Sheraton was renovated in summer 2018, and the guest rooms now have sleek, all-white bathrooms and light, airy bedrooms. (The hallways will be renovated shortly.) Since the resort is so spread out, you’ll want to be careful about selecting a room; if you plan on hitting the pool and beach all day, book one that opens out to the grassy area in front of the pool. If you want to get away from the action, book a room that overlooks the ocean and nothing else.', 'Is there a charge for WiFi?\nThe Wi-Fi is included in the $30 daily resort fee.', ""What's on offer in terms of drinking and dining?\nCoral Reef restaurant is open for breakfast only, without the buffet for now. However, takeaway options are available. Later on in the day, guests can head to Mai Tai for an open-air lunch or dinner, overlooking the pool and beach, and take in the nightly torch lighting and cliff-diving ceremony. Naturally, a mai tai is recommended."", 'Any thoughts about the service?\nThe Sheraton is a fairly large resort (more than 500 rooms) in a crowded area. Service at times can be perfunctory.', ""What's the crowd like?\nFamilies and couples who’ve cashed in their Marriott points for a relatively inexpensive Maui getaway."", 'Tell us about the neighborhood.\nKaanapali is home to several big hotel resorts like \nWestin\n, \nHyatt\n, and Marriott. All are fairly crowded and none feel particularly local; the Sheraton, however, has the Black Rock, which has excellent snorkeling.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\nThere are often not enough chairs at the pool—stake your claim early."", ""Anything else we should know?\nThe hotel’s original lobby, where Elvis Presley filmed a scene for \nBlue Hawaii,\n still remains (although check-in has been moved to a new building). You can head up to the original lobby and admire some cool black-and-white photos of the property from the 1960s and '70s; additionally, just past the original lobby is the hotel’s Ali’i Suite, the largest on the property, which has a gigantic patio with unobstructed views of the coast."", ""Bottom line: Worth it?

Almost every A-lister has stayed here."", 'How are the rooms?\nThe resort ditched the bulky furniture in 2016, replacing it with streamlined, unfettered pieces, neutral colors, and pops of Hawaiian artwork and textiles. Although the marble bathrooms are themselves little dens of luxury, the proprietary Four Seasons Bed is the star, complete with temperature-regulation technology and pillow menu. The rest of the in-room technology is on point, as evidenced by the 65-inch TVs, digital tablets on nightstands, and plenty of outlets. All rooms also have a sleeper sofa that pulls out into a queen bed. Ocean-view rooms are typically more than $1,000 a night, as are the special Club Floor rooms, which afford access to a private lounge and staff.

At night, the place turns into a casual steakhouse. Diners can also opt for Italian fare at Ferraro’s, and the second-floor Spago from Wolfgang Puck remains one of Wailea's best spots for a romantic sunset dinner."", 'Was the service up to standards?\nThere’s hardly anything to criticize about the staff here; everyone is genuinely friendly and eager to help with anything, whether it be finding the perfect spot by the pool or breaking down a stroller. Staff even answers text requests.', 'Who else is staying here?\nYoung newlyweds, families with small children, older couples, and Four Seasons loyalists.', ""What about the neighborhood?\nThere are several high-end hotels in a row, along with residences, golf courses, tennis courts, a shopping center, and a scenic coastal path. Yes, it’s a manufactured neighborhood, but it's more spread out than Kaanapali."", 'Any negatives?\nThe adults-only Serenity pool, where two Missoni cabanas are available to rent, is a bit small, and it fills up quickly.', ""What are the hotel's other features?\nFour Seasons is one of the only resorts in Wailea that doesn’t charge a resort fee, which feels like a friendly gesture even though room rates are high. Complimentary services outside the in-room amenities include poolside snacks, an intro scuba clinic, an outrigger canoe paddling expedition, a well-outfitted fitness center (complete with Peloton bikes), and pool cabanas. There’s also an Aloha Suite lounge for folks with early arrivals and late departures, and a complimentary Kids For All Seasons program.

You know you’ve arrived when the hotel-packed shoreline gives way to immaculately landscaped wide-open spaces and roads lined with towering Cook pines from the resort’s plantation days when it grew coffee and pineapples. This exclusive 22,000-acre enclave fronts two marine reserves and is home to only two hotels. The 466-room Ritz-Carlton Maui, Kapalua is fantastic, but the Montage is in a league of its own. The smallest of its 50 residential-style accommodations clocks in at a palatial 1,250 square feet. And, should you understandably decide to stay put, you don’t have to miss out on any of the hotel’s perks. Dishes, like kanpachi and shrimp curry, from signature restaurant Cane & Canoe are available for room service, and the resort can arrange a full chef’s table experience with wine pairings and live music en suite. But it is worth throwing on a cover-up or a T-shirt over your swimsuit for a visit to the spa. With eight hales—freestanding outdoor treatment rooms surrounded by bamboo gardens—and an infinity pool with island views, it’s a destination in itself.

Indeed, if you’re aiming for seclusion and relaxation, rather than sunny beach days, the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua is just the spot. And if you’re staying a while or traveling with children, opt for a residential suite which has a full kitchen and up to two bedrooms. Just be sure to reserve your chairs in advance before you go to the pool. ","[""What will we notice when we arrive?\nWinding along the entrance to the Ritz-Carlton you’ll notice the topography looks different than the coastal scenery you’ve passed en route from Maui's main airport. Kapalua is marked by lush, towering trees (some of them pine) and windy weather; it might even be raining when you pull up to the hotel, giving the whole vibe a mountain-lodge feel. Indeed, if you’re aiming for seclusion and relaxation rather than sunny beach days, this Ritz is just the spot."", ""What's the backstory?\nKapalua, a resort community developed by the Maui Land & Pineapple Company, includes residences, two luxury hotels, two golf courses, tennis courts, hiking trails, and a few shops and restaurants. The Ritz-Carlton fronts a portion of Honokahua Bay where, when the construction began in 1987, an ancient burial site was discovered along the shore. The hotel then scrapped its plans to build a beachfront and moved inland. Visitors can learn more about its history during their stay."", 'How are the rooms?\nTraveling with three kids, including a one-year-old, our family opted for a one-bedroom residential suite. The setup was perfect for our needs, with a bedroom, a kitchen, a sitting area with a pullout couch, and a wide balcony overlooking the pool. The furniture and amenities are new, including dark wood floors, pretty area rugs, and cooking utensils. The bathroom was a bit small, but it had a shower and a tub along with posh Dyptique toiletries. One note: Getting to the rooms can be a little bit confusing since the hotel has two wings that don’t connect, so you’ll need to make sure to set off from the lobby level in the correct direction. If you’re aiming to spend a lot of time at the pool or down by the beach, pick a room close to the back elevator. Wi-Fi is included in the $40 daily resort fee, along with fitness classes, Kapalua Resort shuttle service, beach chair and umbrella setup daily (for Marriott Bonvoy Elite Guests), a lei greeting, and resort activities.', 'What kind of restaurants will we find here?\nThe modern Ulana restaurant (the Hawaiian word for “weave”) serves a sprawling breakfast buffet. Several other options on the property range from casual to elegant and even to-go, but the highlight is actually the beachside Burger Shack, located at the entrance to the ultra-secluded beach. The menu is simple but perfect, with burgers, milkshakes, and craft beers.', 'How is the service?\nUtterly smooth and gracious—and completely understanding when the kids get a little rambunctious.', ""What are the guests like?\nThis crowd feels similar to that of a country club, perhaps thanks to Kapalua's championship golf courses. Otherwise, the mix is typical: honeymooners, families, and retirees. But thanks to the low-key vibe and the widely spread-out property, you’re not constantly running into them."", ""And the area?\nKapalua is not what you’d expect from a Maui vacation, thanks to its different topography and fussy weather. If you're craving a beach getaway, head down the coast to Kaanapali or Wailea."", 'Anything else we should know?\nThe Ritz-Carlton is especially kid-friendly; its Jean-Michel Cousteau Ambassadors to the Environment program allows little ones to enroll in morning and afternoon activities. We also loved the full playground near the kiddie pool. For non-parents, the resort has three other pools, including an adults-only one; the top pool is lined with large, tricked-out cabanas with flat-screen TVs and fully stocked mini-fridges. Lastly, if you’re getting tired of pricey resort food, visit Honolua Market, just beyond the resort, to stock up on snacks at more earthly prices.', ""Bottom line.\nA Maui resort that truly let you hide away?

It’s immediately clear that Andaz is one of the most modern resorts on Maui—indeed, it’s one of the newer resorts here—making you feel as if you’re in a rich relative’s modernist beach house. Adding to that comfortable feeling is the check-in process, which, per Andaz brand standards, happens via tablets while you sit and relax with a welcome drink, rather than at a front desk. Of course, ocean and pool views—there are four pools total—are front and center here too."", ""What's the backstory?\nThis was formerly a ho-um Renaissance Hotel until Hyatt demolished the building and turned it into one of the first resorts under its boutique-style Andaz brand in late 2013, making it one of the newer resorts in Wailea. David Rockwell, of the Rockwell Group, spearheaded the fresh, contemporary look."", 'How are the rooms?\nGuest rooms are simple and modern, with white shutters, linens, gray area rugs, and teak furniture. Bathrooms are encased in lava stone; some feature deep-soaking tubs. There are complimentary minibar snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. Although all rooms have private lanais, they tend to be on the smaller side compared to other resorts. If space is a must, book a suite category or higher. For bigger families, two- and three-bedroom ocean villas provide space, comfort, convenience, and direct access to the pool and beach.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nKa’ana Kitchen, Andaz's all-day restaurant, serves an epic breakfast buffet featuring Hawaiian and Western specialties and even a juice mixologist.

Morimoto Maui is the resort's fine-dining sushi destination (book in advance), and a 24-hour market stocks tasty to-go food, wine, coffee, snacks, and acai bowls."", 'How about getting around?\nThe property has an unusual layout—the experience begins at the top of the complex with check-in, then winds down a hill to the beach. There are elevators and walkways for those with small children and mobility issues, but it can be a lot of steps to walk when you’re returning from the beach.', 'Anything to say about the service?\n Staffers are super-friendly and accommodating, and the overall mood is a laid-back and casual, rather than formal and uptight.', ""Who's staying here?\nThose who can’t handle an overcrowded and manufactured resort experience—creative types, seasoned world travelers, and well-off young folks—often seek out the Andaz because it has figured out how to do luxury without falling prey to touristy schlock."", 'What about the neighborhood? What else is here\nThe Andaz is at the end of the Wailea coastal path, a small distance away from a cluster of nearby resorts and a bit farther from The Shops at Wailea.

The ‘Awili Spa is apothecary-style; choose among local herbs, plants, and fruits for a customized lotion to take home after your treatment. The resort also has a great kids' club (called Hub 808) for those ages 5-12.

In 2018, she and her mother purchased a dilapidated building in Condesa and enlisted the architect Pablo Pérez Palacios to tear down the crumbling structure and transform the lot into their dream bed and breakfast: Octavia Casa. Upon entry, guests are greeted by a breezy seating area with bamboo stools centered around a concrete table, by the interior architecture firm Habitación 116, plus a bronze rack of shoppable items by Octavia, from white button-up shirts to black-and-white snakeskin two-piece sets.', 'The rooms:\n The seven suites have a whitewashed, elemental palette, and are each named after a natural element or material, from walnut (nogal) and linen (lino), to earth (tierra) and bronze (bronce). All rooms have king-size beds, and there are two larger studios available that are more apartment-style (without a kitchen). The work of Mexican designers are also on display in the suites, from blown-glass cups by Onora Casa to cream-colored vases by the ceramics studio Encrudo—plus silky-soft cotton linens by Octavia Casa’s line of home accessories.', 'Food and drink:\n The property doesn’t have a restaurant but they do offer breakfast in the ground-floor courtyard, with its pebbled floor and guava tree. Breakfast is brought in every morning from a local bakery, and usually includes made-fresh Nespresso coffee, plus ciabatta bread and traditional Mexican pastries like conchas that are served with honey and homemade hibiscus-and-ginger jam. For evenings, the hotel offers an array of natural Mexican wines for guests to enjoy on the rooftop, from bottles of Bichi (the first-ever natural wine brand in Mexico produced in Tecate) to Piel de Luna, a line from Lucas D’Acosta made in Valle de Guadalupe.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n The property is in Condesa, one of the poshest neighborhoods in \nMexico City\n that’s known for its green spaces, specifically two parks: Parque Espana and Parque Mexico. The area is where Mexico City’s Art Deco movement took shape in the late 1920s to early 1930s. Typically, Condesa attracts a young, affluent, and international set who enjoy dining alfresco and adopt a healthy lifestyle—you can often see locals running on Amsterdam Avenue or walking their dogs in the park. The property is within walking distance of some of the top eateries and bars in the city, like the Italian restaurant Lardo by celebrated Mexican chef Elena Reygadas, the hip cafe Quentin known for some of the best coffee in the city, and the new natural wine bar Caiman by the owners of the furniture design firm La Metropolitana.', 'The service:\n The service is low-key and casual, though the staff is present, delightful, and there to make any guest feel cared for during a stay. The team can arrange reservations and connect guests with local companies for food tours, cooking classes, and more.', 'Anything left to mention?\n This is not the place to stay if you want to relax indoors and enjoy room service, as there’s no in-room dining. It’s more for travelers who are eager to get out and explore one of the best neighborhoods in Mexico City and want a soft place to land at the end of the day.']","Avenida Amatlan 126, Mexico City 06170, Mexico",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/mexico-city/octavia-casa,https://octaviacasa.mx/
Brick Hotel,,2,"This is a sleek, design-forward option in the heart of Mexico City’s Colonia Roma, where everything the coveted neighborhood has to offer—from its shady 19th-century boulevards to the fresh pastries at Panadería Rosetta—is just steps away. Staying at an Airbnb might be the way to feel like a local here, but trotting up the Brick Hotel’s sweeping, palm-shrouded steps at the end of an evening leaves you feeling just as relevant. Reopened in 2019 (after an initial 2010 opening), the Brick is far more modern than the Belle Epoque architecture surrounding it suggests. But the building is steeped in its own history: The original house, or Gran Casona, that predated the hotel was built in the early 20th century from bricks shipped over from England to create a private estate for the original manager of the Bank of London and Mexico. Mexico City has no shortage of boutique and design hotels at this point, but few sit on quite as perfect a block as the Brick’s Calle Orizaba, one of the neighborhood’s main arteries.","['Why book?\n This is a sleek, design-forward option in the heart of \nMexico City\n’s Colonia Roma, where everything the coveted neighborhood has to offer—from its shady 19th-century boulevards to the fresh pastries at \nPanadería Rosetta\n—is just steps away.

(The terrace is pet-friendly, meaning that while I was there, the seat next to me was occupied by a chic Pomeranian.) In contrast to the sun-drenched patio outside, the moody hotel lobby is softly lit regardless of the time of day, complete with dark-leather furniture and barely-there, ambient music. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of place for families—rather, it’s a boutique hotel more suited to the business execs and affluent couples checking in to spend a long weekend in one of the world’s best cities. Remote workers may want to hang out here tapping away on a laptop, but the hotel’s central Roma location means that the desire to explore the myriad bars and restaurants just around the corner make it more of a luxurious basecamp rather than the mainstay of your trip—a quality the property seems perfectly content possessing.', 'The backstory\n Reopened in 2019 (after an initial 2010 opening), the Brick is far more modern than the Belle Epoque architecture surrounding it suggests. But the building is steeped in its own history: The original house, or Gran Casona, that predated the hotel was built in the early 20th century from bricks shipped over from England to create a private estate for the original manager of the Bank of London and Mexico. Many of those bricks still remain as part of the listed original structure (hence the hotel name), but the place is now also decked out with subtly contemporary fixings, like floor-to-ceiling glass windows, industrial-style pendant light fixtures, and a discreet glass elevator hidden behind the trees. A nod to the over a century-old building’s chameleon-like nature—in previous lives it also took the form as a bordello and a locksmith shop—the restaurant, Cerrajeria Restaurant, is named after the latter.', 'The rooms\n Mine was one of four Rooftop Suites (Brick is home to 10 rooms and seven suites, total) and exactly where I wanted to be at the end of a day spent scarfing down tacos at various mercados. The queen-sized bed was layered with crisp white sheets and accented with textiles; pillows and a blanket throw in case things got chilly, a nice detail given the breezy balcony overlooking Orizaba that the lower level opens out to. Hidden among the treetops, it felt like an oasis above the throng of \nMexico City\n, made even better by the springtime jacaranda flowers that had just bloomed. Back inside, the suite’s design was all muted tones of charcoal, cream, and light gray; the bathrooms were simple, with rain showers and plush towels. The surprise bonus? A claw-foot tub on the upper level of the suite, set against a marble backdrop and accompanied by an array of bath products from Mexico-based Persea Apothecary, as well as candles to help you decompress. Other room perks included well-stocked mini bars on both floors, as well as a bottle of mezcal awaiting me upon check in.', 'The spa\n The Brick’s Hela Spa is small, tucked-away out of sight from the rest of the property—but offers up all the options one would expect from a high-end property. Services include massages, facials, and body wraps, and there is also a sauna and steam room should you need to sweat out some of that mezcal.', ""The neighborhood/area\n Mexico City has no shortage of boutique and design hotels at this point, but few sit on quite as perfect a block as the Brick’s Calle Orizaba, one of the neighborhood’s main arteries. Roma, of course, has spent the better part of the past decade emerging as the city’s hottest neighborhood—and you’ll be hard pressed to walk more than a few feet without stumbling upon a coctelería, ceviche spot, or vintage store worthy of whiling away a few hours. Moreover, it’s walking distance from destination restaurants: there's \nRosetta\n and its sister bakery, Panadería Rosetta (don’t sleep on the house-made guava jam as a souvenir); Condesa, home to yet more beautiful architecture and palm-lined public parks; and \nContramar\n, the Mexico City staple known for its unrivaled tuna tostadas and famous (and overly-Instagrammed) red-and-green grilled snapper. You’d be forgiven for forgetting to leave the neighborhood entirely, but design enclaves like \nCasa Luis Barragan\n and the \nMuseo Frida Kahlo\n are both reasonable Uber rides away, depending on how jammed the capital’s notorious traffic is."", 'The service\n Low-key and nearly invisible, but never missed.

By night, the black marble and brass fixtures in the Deco-inspired bar echo the view of the city below, with its pinpoints of light climbing the flanks of the surrounding hills. Cocktails like the Taxco update classics with local ingredients, in this an Old Fashioned dyed a rich, rusty red with a spice called axiote, and accompanied by a piece of cardamom- and pistachio-studded white chocolate painted with edible silver from its namesake town.', 'The spa:\n The only part of the Ritz-Carlton Reforma that turns inward, the chic spa is as intimate and introspective as the rooms are airy and bright. Marble, the color of graphite, encases an elevated lap pool, while labyrinthine halls paneled in lustrous woods connect the changing rooms and saunas to impeccably appointed treatment areas for a perfect massage.', 'The service:\n Staff was formal but friendly, if also, at times, a little scattered after only a week in operation.', 'The neighborhood:\n It doesn’t get much more central than this in Mexico City’s vast urban landscape. From the door, several of the city’s best museums, nestled in a superlative urban park, are a few minutes walk away, as are the vibrant neighborhoods of la Juarez, la Cuauhtemoc, la Roma, and la Condesa, where you’ll have access to many of the city’s coolest restaurants, bars, and galleries. The swankier district of Polanco is practically next door, with its parade of designer shops and high-end dining.', 'Anything left to mention?:\n The views are spectacular, but the thick glass panels that separate the balconies from the open air tend to magnify the afternoon sun while also blocking the mountain breezes that keep this high-altitude city cool, making them practically unusable through much of the day. Still, they’re a pleasant place for a morning coffee, when the sun is behind you, and an ideal lookout point for gorgeous mountain sunsets.']","Av.

Condesa DF,"Gold List, 2020.",3,"Mexico City’s first design boutique hotel was cool before the capital was hot. Before international chefs made pilgrimages to Pujol to eat grasshopper and self-proclaimed foodies posted photos of mouthwatering tacos al pastor. And the fact is, 20 years in, Condesa DF is still—if not the shiniest or most elegant hotel—the coolest. In large part, this comes down to excellent design. Grupo Habita (the homegrown hospitality brand behind low-key Oaxacan beach retreat Hotel Escondido and retro-hip The Robey in Chicago) took a neoclassic, 1920s apartment building with arched windows and French balconettes and tapped Mexican architect Javier Sanchez and Iranian-French designer India Mahdavi to transform it. The pair created a space so contemporary it still feels trailblazing. Sleek metal shades close off the guest rooms from the open-air atrium. Mod, Jetsons-like furniture (a white semicircle-shaped leather couch, lacquered tables that look like Bishop chess pieces) paired with bold but spare hits of color, like turquoise walls and lemon-yellow chairs. The hotel, encircled by palms and pines and just a few steps from Parque España, one of the city’s prettiest squares where creatives stroll with their dogs mid-day and teenage couples steal kisses, is itself a retreat from the constant whirl of the surrounding megalopolis while still being in the middle of one of its liveliest neighborhoods. Of the five different room types, the corner suites with wrap-around terraces stand out, especially in the spring when the jacaranda trees erupt in a riot of purple.

But check into your butler-serviced, Yabu-Pushelberg-designed suite, outfitted in a neutral palette, and you'll feel right at home. The four restaurants, two pools, cabana-lined beachfront, and adjacent Bal Harbour shops offer a bevy of entertainment and leisure.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nStepping into The St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort feels a little bit like entering an abstract art gallery: the entryway is a largely empty room, save for an enormous metal sculpture hanging from the ceiling and a few tufted chairs and couches that you may or may not be allowed to sit on. Keep walking and you’ll find yourself in the lobby, which is equally artistic with its dark marble floors, massive chandeliers, and geometric, mirrored walls.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nI splurged on a butler-serviced Astor Oceanfront Junior Suite, which, at 675 square feet, was more than big enough for two people. It had a separate dining room, lounge area, and kitchenette. As is customary of design duo Yabu Pushelberg, the room was largely outfitted in a neutral palette, with pops of color throughout and a gold/mirrored headboard-slash-installation in the bedroom. The pièce de résistance, however, was the 210 square-foot balcony.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nClimbing out of the fluffy king-sized bed each morning was no easy task. (Maybe I should have called the butler.)', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies.

Toiletries come from the on-site Remède Spa.', 'We all need some good Wi-Fi. What’s the word on that?\nHigh-speed Wi-Fi is complimentary throughout the property; guest rooms also have wired internet connections.', 'What\'s going on with food and drink here?\nThe St. Regis has four different restaurants, including a gourmet burger bar, a French café (go for afternoon tea), a mezze-focused Greek restaurant, and a wine bar. All of those specialties, plus more, can be ordered at any time of the day via the staff. Do yourselves a favor and start each day with the hotel\'s ""Bloody Sunrise,"" a Florida twist on the Bloody Mary, with a surprising citrus zest.', 'Did the staff make an impression?\nThe St. Regis’s staff is pro and proactive about anticipating your needs. I received an email a week before our trip asking if there was anything that they could do to prepare for our arrival.', 'What about the spa?', 'Inspired by Caroline Astor The St. Regis Spa is a 14,000 square-foot cathedral of pampering with a warren of 12 treatment rooms and facials and body treatments using luxurious product lines like Sothy’s, Omorovicza, and Intraceuticals.

If you really want to treat yourself, book an Oceanfront Day Villa; the 600-square-foot beach cabana has air-conditioning, a flat-screen TV, mini-fridge, and shower. If you’ve ever wanted to witness someone open a bottle of bubbly with a sword, make sure you’re in the St. Regis Bar and Wine Vault by 7:30 p.m., when a nightly sabering demonstration takes place.', ""Bottom line: worth it?\nAll of this luxury and personal attention doesn’t come cheap, so if you’re planning a stay here, take full advantage of the amenities.

Whites and earth tones gave it a clean, contemporary feel, and tan accents delivered a stylish flourish. The oversized leather armchairs felt especially luxurious, as did the marble bathroom.

Their Thai beef salad ($19) proved a wonderful way to end the day.', 'Did the staff make an impression?\nChecking into a hotel can be a fairly arduous task, especially if you arrive at the same time as a couple of other soon-to-be guests. The front desk here keeps a constant eye on who’s arriving and what they need, and shrink and grow the staff in an instant to make sure you’re not left standing in line or waiting for anything (they also value their guests’ privacy). This is efficiency at its most impressive.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features?\nAs you walk through the hotel lobby and outside toward the beach, a lush courtyard and serenity pond remind you that your only job right now is to relax. Want to do that on the beach? The hotel has its own private stretch of sand where you can chill out on a day bed and grab a bite from The Setai Beach Kitchen, a solar-powered culinary spot. If you’re itching to be a bit more adventurous, they’ve got Jet Skis for rent.

If you think the lobby has a chill vibe, try spending a night in one of the Ocean Suites.', 'Bottom line: Is it worth it?\nConsidering that Jay-Z, Beyoncé, and Madonna are all fans of The Setai, it goes without saying that the hotel isn’t going to make any budget traveler’s list of top \nSouth Beach\n accommodations.

Popular with families or couples who would rather not be in the heart of the city, this outpost of the Ritz-Carlton also draws Miami locals for dinner—and tequila—at its popular Mexican restaurant, Cantina Beach, which has over 100 varieties of tequila on its shelves.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nKey Biscayne may only be located 15 miles from \nSouth Beach\n, but it may as well be its very own country. The picturesque barrier island is home to miles of pristine beachfront and two state parks, but only one hotel—and what a hotel it is. The Ritz-Carlton, Key Biscayne has all the five-star amenities you’d expect from the high-end hotel chain, but also embraces the laid-back, beachy vibe of its neighborhood. In a way, it’s the place you’d want to go to escape Miami.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nThough Ritz-Carlton devotees like to remain true to their brand, they have a handful of options—and hotel personalities—to choose from in the area, including outposts in South Beach, Bal Harbour, and Coconut Grove. The Key Biscayne crowd can be heavily weighted toward the family side, or couples who would rather not be in the heart of the city.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nIn order to take advantage of the hotel’s slightly out-of-the-way location, we booked an Ocean View Studio, mainly because of its residential features, which make it feel more like your own little apartment than a stuffy hotel room. With 420 square feet of space, it’s a good size without being too big. And its clever layout allows for a kitchenette and other home-away-from-home features. The room is pretty—lots of light blues and beiges, plus light wood furniture and accessories replicate the colors of the sea—even if there’s no real statement piece or “wow” element. Even so, one could be perfectly content calling it home for even an extended stay. The balcony makes a pleasant addition, especially as a place to enjoy an evening cocktail or morning coffee.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe vast majority of the main floor space is taken up by the king-sized bed, which is topped with a luxurious feather comforter.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nOur main reason for opting for the Ocean View Studio was the added bonus of a kitchenette, which was well-equipped with a stove, stovetop, microwave and mini-fridge. It’s options like this that make the resort a popular choice for families, so that you’re not left dragging a sun-soaked and exhausted kid from one restaurant to the next.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nWhile not huge, the marble bathroom feels luxurious, not only because of its separate tub and shower, but because of its super plush towels, robes, and slippers, and the gorgeous mother-of-pearl wall covering near the vanity.', 'We all need some good Wi-Fi. What’s the word on that?\nWi-Fi is complimentary, and strong enough that I was able to download a couple of massive files without shutting the whole resort down (at least, not that I know of).', 'Did anyone on staff make an impression?\nThe Ritz-Carlton is known for employing all sorts of unique butlers and very specific concierges, and here you’ll find a Photography Concierge—a hospitality professional whose job it is to arrange (complimentary) 45-minute beach photo shoots with guests. It’s a lot of work, and there was a long line of people wanting to get in on that.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nBeach or pool? It’s a decision made even more difficult here, as the resort is home to a pair of pools—one of them a more family-oriented type (complete with waterfall), the other adults-only. If the resort didn’t already remind you of the last place you stayed in Cabo, Cantina Beach—its gorgeous, thatched palapa-roofed Mexican eatery—might get those memories back. Tiki torches and fire pits only add to the beachfront charm, and a dedicated tequilier—the tequila version of a sommelier—can help you choose the perfect tequila to match your meal for a night you won’t soon forget. The restaurant, which stocks more than 110 varieties of tequila, also hosts complimentary tastings at 6 p.m. nightly.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Key Biscayne is unique in that it lets you enjoy all the benefits and privacy of staying at a secluded resort, yet you’re always just a quick drive to the heart of South Beach—and just as close to the airport.', 'Bottom line: worth it?\nWhile Miami is full of Instagram-worthy beaches and backdrops, Key Biscayne’s version of it is just a little less tainted by urban sprawl. Its proximity to Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, home to one of Florida’s most beautiful beaches, puts you that much closer to yet another activity to check off your Miami bucket list.']","455 Grand Bay Dr., Key Biscayne, Florida 3149, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/key-biscayne/ritz-carlton-key-biscayne,http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/KeyBiscayne/Default.htm
Arlo Wynwood Miami,,1,"The first hotel to officially open in Wynwood, Miami’s graffiti-clad neighborhood that’s now home to dozens of galleries, shops and restaurants—the splashy Arlo is an art-filled oasis that seeks to strike a balance between being a splashy getaway and a vibrant urban hotel.

There’s an inviting 9th floor rooftop pool with a cocktail bar and views of the Miami skyline. The hotel also strives to be a hub of activity for its guests with weekly programming like comedy nights, fitness classes and space devoted to loungey co-working environments with a pool table and a yoga deck.

The casual atmosphere and community-driven environment are a good fit for Wynwood which still has a scruffy quality to it, despite rapid development and commercialization that has occurred in the last few years.', 'The rooms', 'Despite having an active restaurant and bar scene, the hotel’s 217 guest rooms provide a peaceful place to rest up and recharge. In keeping with the hotel’s simple-but-modern aesthetic the rooms are outfitted in white-oak furnishings, bedside wireless charging stations, Bluetooth radios, LED TVs featuring staycast capabilities, and complimentary WiFi, as well as mini fridges, Nespresso coffee machines, and Pharmacopia bath products. The most basic King rooms don’t come with balconies and are low on frills so if you’re looking for more of an in-room experience its best to upgrade to a Balcony King or one of the handful of suites that come with seating areas and more space.', 'Food and drink', 'The hotel aims to be a destination for both food and cocktails having tapped local mavens to execute on both fronts. Talented chef Brad Kilgore (James Beard \n“Best Chef: South”\n nominee and \nFood & Wine\n “Best New Chefs in America” alumnus) heads up the ground-floor Marygold’s Florida Brasserie with dishes ofcoconut-gouda mousse Oxtail Beignets, Mahi Mahi cooked with aji amarillo and Short Rib Vaca Frita with roasted maduro purée. The dining room is awash in warm lighting, natural woods and lush greenery surrounded by a combination of intimate booths, spacious banquettes, and central tables, all perched perfectly to watch the action unfold in the open kitchen. Higher Ground, the hotel’s third-floor cocktail-centric lounge is headed up by Bar Lab Hospitality who cemented their place on the international cocktail map with their wildly-popular Broken Shaker concept. The indoor-outdoor lounge features an indoor billiards room in a stylish living room setup while outside funky, hand-painted benches surround a beautiful Seagrape tree while wicker chairs, swings and chaises are perfectly situated amongst the lush Miami flora.', 'The spa', 'The hotel lacks a spa but does have an extensive fitness center and a roster of classes for guests that includes yoga on an outdoor deck and bootcamp classes.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Wynwood has long been known as one of Miami’s edgiest neighborhoods with galleries, boutiques and a bounty of restaurants within a 5 block radius. You’ll want to spend a lot of time pounding the pavement here, with so much to see and taste all around. Miami’s pristine beaches are an easy 15-minute ride over the causeway should you want some ocean time.', 'The service', 'Friendly, professional and young—the hotel definitely sees itself as a fresh-faced addition to the hospitality landscape.', 'For families', 'Though the hotel is not specifically geared to families, it’s a fine option for parents looking for a stylish base for exploring Wynwood. Some of the suites offer connectivity to king rooms making it ideal for families and the restaurant kitchen can accommodate the palates of little ones, offering simple pasta dishes (though they’re not listed on the menu).', 'Anything left to mention?', 'While the hotel is lacking in certain frills (like no room service) there are also thoughtful touches like complimentary fortune cookies in the rooms with unique fortunes and bicycles for guests to explore the neighborhood.']","2217 NW Miami Ct, Miami, FLorida 33127, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/miami/arlo-wynwood,https://arlohotels.com/wynwood/

In addition to the five-star amenities and 600 feet of private beach, regular events—like sunset meditation and terrarium-building workshops—keep guests coming back.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nWe’ve got a serious soft spot for any hotel that wears its eco-consciousness on its sleeve, and understands that it takes more than asking guests to reuse a bath towel to truly effect change. 1 Hotel South Beach’s entire brand is built around a fierce commitment to sustainability, which is apparent as soon as you pull up to the front door (the giant “1” that marks the spot was constructed out of 7,500 pounds of local Florida coral). Inside, floor-to-ceiling windows offer picturesque beach views, but also reduce the building’s energy footprint. You’ll spot lots of reclaimed wood on the walls and gorgeous pieces of driftwood furniture, not to mention a farmstand in the lobby. Even the room keys are made of various kinds of recycled wood. Environmentalism never looked so sexy.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nThough the hotel’s beachfront location—and 600 square feet of private sand out front—certainly isn’t discouraging any guests from booking a room, it’s clear that the visitors to 1 Hotel are looking for something that goes beyond that. Sure, they expect all the amenities that any five-star hotel would offer, but they also want to feel like they’re giving back a bit, too. The hotel’s reliance on local vendors and artisans is one way guests know they’re helping the community, but they also love the hotel’s dedication to wellness. A regular schedule of events, including sunset meditation and terrarium-building workshops, are just the kind of thing that sell them on booking.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nMother Nature’s inspiration isn’t just for show in the lobby; her presence can be felt in all 425 of the hotel’s rooms and suites, which feature driftwood walls, recycled pine headboards, hemp blend-filled mattresses, 100 percent organic cotton sheets, clothes hangers made from recycled paper, and even your very own glass terrarium to bring the outdoors in. We opted for an Ocean View King With Balcony, as the chance to catch up on some reading or drink coffee with our very own sea breezes seemed too good to pass up. The room was stunning, and—at 650 square feet—unexpectedly large. Layout is notable, too; there are no walls that separate the sleeping area from the living area, and only a glass wall separates the shower from the bedroom, yet each area’s purpose is clear and distinct. The wraparound couch looked right out the balcony door (so in many ways, having that extra bit of outdoor space could be redundant for those who just want the views). Waking up to the sounds, and smells, of the ocean is not a feeling we’ll soon forget.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nLike the rest of the furniture, the bed offered an ideal mix of comfort and eco-consciousness; the mattress, by Keetsa, is made of custom organic cotton, and the sheets are 100 percent organic cotton, too.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nYou know that bottled water you’re always complaining about having to pay $10 for in a hotel room, but guzzling down anyway? There will be none of that here. All of the hotel’s taps, sinks, and showers are equipped with Triple Clear Water filters, so you can drink right from them—and even the glasses in your room are made from recycled glass.', ""Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nWhile the shower’s water filter may have been installed with conservation in mind, the hotel didn't skimp on the \nsize\n of that shower. Most of the walk-in marble showers have an all-glass wall on one side, so you can lather up with an oceanfront view if you so choose (there are curtains if you’d rather leave something to the imagination). Products are custom designed for the hotel itself, and made with a range of natural ingredients, while the towels and robes are both made from natural cotton knits—as are the socks they leave in your room to forgo the waste pairs of slippers can bring."", 'We all need some good Wi-Fi. What’s the word on that?\nWi-Fi worked perfectly in every corner of the hotel, and it didn’t cost a penny.', 'What stuck out about the staff?\nNot every hotel owns a slice of the beach, and 1 Hotel makes the most of that with a dedicated team of sandy-footed helpers who can fetch you everything from a lounge chair to a cocktail. This is what you’re here for; give them all a raise.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nWhile the hotel’s private beachfront is a surprisingly rare amenity in South Beach, Watr 1 at the Rooftop—a pool deck and bar located 18 stories up above the water—is yet another amenity worth taking advantage of. If you plan to keep active, there’s a SoulCycle onsite (just be sure to sign up for your class ASAP, as it’s open to the public, too).', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\n1 Hotel’s eco-friendly stance was admittedly a big selling point on booking a room here, and it did not disappoint.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nIf leaving behind a tiny carbon footprint is important to you, it’s worth visiting 1 Hotel’s website to see the ways (many of them unexpectedly simple) they’re helping to give back to the community and environment they call home.']","2341 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, Florida 33139, USA",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/miami-beach/1-hotel-south-beach,https://1hotels.com/south-beach

At Acqualina, you'll have all that and much, much more. It's true: You'll be a half-hour car ride from the energy of Miami Beach, but what you get in return is worth it. A few of the highlights: oversized rooms with oceanfront views, three pools, and relief from the see-and-be-seen restaurants that populate so many beachside storefronts. Serenity-seekers unite.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nWhile Miami has its share of standout beachfront hotels, the sheer width of Miami Beach means that even if you get a room overlooking the ocean, you'll still have to spend a couple minutes walking across hot sand in order to dip your toes in the water. For travelers who don’t care about being in the heart of South Beach, and would rather not leave their hotel at all if it could be helped, there’s Acqualina. Channeling a kind of Italian villa feel, the hotel has practically built itself into the water’s edge, to beautifully dramatic effect."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nPeople who want to enjoy all the natural beauty and doses of vitamin D that Florida has to offer—without being beholden to the crowds in South Beach—are the ideal Acqualina guests. Families are also a frequent sight, as the resort rents large suites complete with full kitchens, which can be a blessing for families with young kids.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nWith a grand total of 615 square feet of space (725 square feet, if you include the balcony), our Oceanfront Room—which carves out its own little seating area—was large enough to make us feel like we even had a bit of privacy from each other. White, tan, and grey tones let the water be the real pop of color, and the room’s smoked glass and bronze metal coffee tables add a little bit of an edge to its elegance.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nIn addition to being both comfortable and elegant, with its metallic-like silver throw pillows, the bed’s positioning right in front of the floor-to-ceiling glass balcony door ensured that we woke up to a beautiful view.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nWhile the balcony—which added more than 100 square feet to the room’s size—was undoubtedly of the room’s most charming amenities, a small foyer and private bar area were unexpected touches that made the already-big room seem even bigger. A gorgeous wingback chair, which I would have been happy to carry back on to the plane, also added a bit of elegance to the living area.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nLike the main room itself, the bathrooms at Acqualina are large and elegant, from the imported marble flooring to the separate bathtub and huge glass-enclosed shower, all of which encourage lingering while you get ready for your day. Products come courtesy of ESPA and are used in many of the treatments at the hotel’s award-winning spa (which you should plan a separate visit to at some point).', 'Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-Fi is free, and connectivity didn’t seem to be an issue anywhere within the hotel’s 4.5 acres.', 'F&B: What are we looking at?\nCosta Grill serves up a great menu of light bites beachside. At night, Il Mulino New York brings a deeper taste of the Mediterranean to the resort. Ke-uH, the new Japanese restaurant, is ideal for shared plates and fresh fish.', 'Did anyone on staff make an impression?\nDeciding to stay a good 30-40 minute drive from South Beach (and some of our favorite restaurants) wasn’t an easy decision to make. But kudos to the reservation assistant I spoke with ahead of booking, who essentially listed the many pros that came with being an Uber ride away from the action—and she was absolutely right.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nWhile grabbing one of the hotel’s plush loungers (and a beach butler to bring you a cocktail) is never a bad idea, the resort is also home to three pools, each with its own temperament: the Beach Club Pool is the main event, where guests of all ages and activity levels lounge and lunge. More active types will love the Recreation Pool, where the staff regularly organizes games and fitness classes. If you’re traveling sans kids, you’ll want to head to the Tranquility Pool—the adults-only spot whose name says it all.', ""What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nIt's natural to feel that if you’re coming to Miami, you’ll want to stay in the city or on Miami Beach. But the tranquility that came with being half-an-hour away from the velvet ropes and see-and-be-seen restaurants actually made for a more relaxing trip. The hotel is also rather self-contained, so if you’re the kind of traveler who likes to plant yourself somewhere and stay, plant away. (Plus, you won't have to pay a resort fee here.)"", 'Bottom line: Is it worth it?\nSeclusion and tranquility are two of the hotel’s most hard-to-ignore amenities, and worth every penny.']","17875 Collins Ave., Sunny Isles Beach, Florida 33160, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/n-miami-beach/acqualina-resort-spa-miami-beach,http://www.acqualinaresort.com/

This 352-room luxury hotel nestled in the heart of the $1 billion Brickell City Centre designed by Miami’s Arquitectonica is in the middle of downtown. The elevator alone, with its infinity mirror, sets the posh, playful tone. The hotel, opened by Hong Kong’s high-end Swire Hotels, has touches like a soaring lobby outfitted in dark woods and a metallic palette of gold, bronze, and silver. Highlights include floor-to-ceiling windows in every guest room and the cloud-skimming rooftop oasis Sugar, with its Asian-inspired bar surrounded by hand-carved teak stools. Rooms are comfortable, but it’s the public spaces that feel most welcoming—the fifth-floor pool deck that seems carved from the concrete pillars of the building with rattan ottomans and the wood-fired Quinto La Huella, an outpost of Uruguayan Parador La Huella. It’s a reminder that Miami is vibrant, multicultural, and metropolitan, far from the beach. From $359.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nThe main thing you need to know about booking a room at EAST, Miami—the 352-room hotel that occupies the top floors of the fabulous (and still-evolving) $1 billion \nBrickell City Centre\n—is that it’s not on the beach. Or anywhere near it. Rather than replicate the easy, breezy, sand-in-your-toes style of South Beach’s grand dames, the EAST, Miami offers a well-placed base from which to explore downtown Miami’s urban charms. You know you’re in for a unique experience as soon as you walk in the door; the lobby is vast and sleek with Asian-inspired touches (which makes sense, as the hotel is the brainchild of Hong Kong’s luxury Swire Hotels).', ""What’s the crowd like?\nBooking a suite at the fanciest beachfront hotel you can find on South Beach is easy, and, as such, draws in a broad-based tourist crowd that doesn't always know much about the city; EAST, Miami caters to travelers who know that Miami’s beauty isn’t just skin-deep, and who are curious to live like a local."", 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nRegardless of the type of room you book, the first thing you’ll notice is also the thing that you’ll remember most: the views. Floor-to-ceiling windows in each room afford a variety of city and water views, depending on where you’re situated. The Corner King includes a wraparound balcony from which one can actually see the Everglades. At 410 square feet, the room is well-sized, but has the illusion of being even bigger, thanks to the high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, neutral color scheme, and gorgeous charcoal-gray wooden floors that let the view take center stage. The Jr. Residence Suite has views of Downtown Miami and Biscayne Bay; a well-stocked kitchenette with a dishwasher, wine fridge, and breakfast bar; a washer and dryer, and even a walk-in closet, which makes it a perfect option for longer stays. Even though each type of room is unique, they’re all super modern and take their feng shui seriously.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nIn addition to being comfortable, the bed in our Corner King was placed right in that corner nook, giving us views from every angle.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nEAST, Miami also features a collection of residential spaces—and visiting guests can sometimes get in on that action. If you want to feel more like you’re staying in a friend’s very cool apartment, opt for a suite with “Residence” in the name. Those are the rooms where you’ll be treated to a host of extras that make the space feel like home—walk-in closets, washers and dryers, dishwashers, kitchens, and beyond.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nWhat’s better than a walk-in glass shower in the bathroom? A walk-in glass rain shower that does its best to make sure you still have those floor-to-ceiling window views of the outside world. APPELLES Apothecary & Lab’s essential oil-infused toiletries are a treat.', 'We all need some good Wi-Fi. What’s the word on that?\nNo complaints about the strong, free Wi-Fi.', ""What's going on here for food and drinks?\nIn a city full of excellent hotel restaurants, EAST, Miami has set the bar even higher, particularly with Quinto La Huella, a rustic, wood-fired offshoot of Uruguay’s famed Parador La Huella. Sugar, the hotel’s rooftop bar and garden, is a magical spot located on the 40th floor. The lush vegetation and jungle-themed décor are a perfect setting for drinks that take a ride on the (slightly) wild side, like the Hakeo, which comprises Jameson, chai tea, blackberries, lemon juice, and absinthe"", 'Did the staff treat you right?\nIn my hurry to catch an early-morning flight on the day of my departure, I ended up leaving an important-to-me item behind. Though I assumed nothing would come of it, I emailed the hotel on the plane home and heard back from the hotel manager in what seemed like an instant, informing me that the item had been located and asking for an address where they could send it.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features?\nJust because you aren't on the beach doesn’t mean that you don’t want to enjoy the sunshine. The hotel’s giant pool deck offers four bodies of water from which to choose: lap pool, spa pool, cold plunge pool, or hot tub. Lounge chairs and poolside food and cocktail service make this easily an all-day affair."", 'Bottom line: Is it worth it?\nIf you’re willing to forgo a trip spent lingering on the beach (you’ll have to grab a taxi or an Uber if you want to do that), being in the thick of Miami’s ever-changing downtown is almost like visiting a whole other city.']","788 Brickell Plaza, Miami, Florida 33131, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/miami/east-miami,https://www.easthotels.com/en/miami/special-offers/

He proved this back in the late ‘70s when, with Steve Rubell, he created New York City’s iconic Studio 54 nightclub. And he did it again in the mid-1990s, when he revamped the classic Delano hotel and helped turn South Beach into one of the world’s favorite beach destinations. For his latest trick, Schrager created a micro-city in the Miami Beach EDITION, where every amenity a person could want (or even know was possible) is there for the taking—ice skating rink included.', 'What’s the crowd like?\nStyle begets style at The Miami Beach EDITION, which has become a playground for fashion-forward types the world over. Drake threw a party for Rihanna here once, and Leonardo DiCaprio hosted three parties in a row for hundreds of his closest friends and strangers during one particularly celebratory edition of Art Basel.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nThere’s something irresistible about the word “bungalow,” so booking one at the Miami Beach EDITION was a no-brainer. While there are seven varieties from which to choose, including a two-story ocean view penthouse bungalow with a private elevator and plunge pool (which rents for $10,000-plus a night), we went with the Bungalow Poolview King. It may not have had its own plunge pool, but it did offer an extra layer of privacy—not to mention separate sleeping, dining, and sitting areas, plus a spacious balcony.

What’s the word on that?\nMiami’s big on the whole “resort fee” thing, and the Miami Beach EDITION is no exception. In this case, it’s a not-totally-insane $35 per night, but part of what you’re paying for is “free” Wi-Fi. Go figure. That said, you’re not getting out of paying that resort fee, so at least the Wi-Fi is strong.', 'Room service: Worth it?\nWith five fabulous restaurants and bars, I only made use of its in-room dining menu once, when I ordered up a plate of rich and buttery pancakes with lavender ($15) just before heading back to the airport.', 'Did anything stand out about the staff?\nAs the majority of my time at the EDITION was spent by the pool, I got to know several of the servers and bar staff at Tropicale, the charming, al fresco café that handles all the beach and poolside food and drink deliveries. Even though the place was packed, they did a wonderful job of making it feel like you were their only customer.', 'Anything we missed?.\nWhether you’re craving a juicy cheeseburger with mole and pickled chili or grilled cobia with habanero-lime sauce, Matador Room— Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s innovative Latin fusion restaurant—offers unexpected flavors in plush surroundings. Cocktails are sublime; order one (or three) with dinner, or make it a liquid meal by foregoing the restaurant altogether and just heading to Matador Bar. The hotel’s most talked-about amenity might very well be BASEMENT, a subterranean entertainment space that is home to what it deems a “micro-club,” a nightclub that’s reminiscent of Studio 54. Which is all well and good, but where it gets really bananas (in a good way) is at the bowling alley and ice skating rink—two nighttime activities you probably never thought you needed, but will hope for in every hotel after this one.', 'Bottom line: Is it worth it?\nAs EDITION is part of the Marriott family, booking a room here is much simpler than at other boutique hotels of its ilk (note: Marriott Rewards can’t be used for the Bungalows). The hotel is totally self-contained, with everything you might need right at your fingertips.']","2901 Collins Ave., Miami, Florida 33140, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/miami-beach/the-miami-beach-edition,http://www.editionhotels.com/miami-beach

New age-y health types will revel in the resort’s array of nutritionists, acupuncturists, physical therapists and energy healers that regularly host workshops and retreats on property.', 'The backstory\n The hotel opened in 1958 and was designed by Norman Giller, the celebrated “father” of Miami Modern (MiMo) architecture. Several design vestiges remain from its heyday welcoming famous guests, lavish parties and cabaret shows including the iconic landmark neon sign at the top of the building. In 2008 two condo towers were added to the refurbished hotel, which opened as a Canyon Ranch and Spa. The hotel was rebranded as the Carillon in 2015, but still kept its focus as a wellness resort.', 'The rooms\n All 150 rooms at the Carillon are suites, and feel like luxury apartments, which is great if you’re traveling with kids or want to cook some of your meals in, rather than dining out during your stay. The one or two-bedroom floor plans come with full kitchens with appliances, spacious living rooms, and large bathrooms with deep soaking tubs. Not all suites feature balconies but the floor-to-ceiling windows bathe the rooms in sunshine, which compliments the blue and neutral-toned color scheme throughout the property.', 'Food and drink\n The main option for dining on property is The Strand restaurant, which serves farm-inspired Mediterranean dishes (think pastas and simply-grilled fish or steak) in a large dining room with an expansive outdoor terrace outfitted in warm woods and earth tones with hues of gold and blue. A separate lounge and bar area serves cocktails and bar bites and is an intimate spot for pre-dinner drinks. The lobby “Corner Store” sells coffee beverages, pastries, and made-to-order juices and smoothies. Poolside lunches of fish tacos and watermelon salads can be had at the cabana-covered Seaglass Cafe overlooking the ocean.', 'The spa\n Access to the Carillon’s 70,000-square-feet Spa and Wellness facility is available at no cost to hotel guests, who can take advantage of the spa’s thermal circuit (which includes a Finnish sauna, crystal steam room, herbal laconium, igloo shower, and hydrotherapy tub) and a variety of exercise classes and wellness workshops. The spa recently introduced “Touchless Wellness” treatments that guests can experience individually complete with a red light therapy pod, an infrared sauna with halotherapy, and vibrational sound therapy rooms.', 'The neighborhood/area\n The hotel’s stretch of A1A isn’t the most interesting so most guests opt to either keep to the property’s upscale amenities, cab it to South Beach (which is 15 minutes away), or go north to the chichi enclaves of Surfside and Bal Harbour for shopping and dining.', 'The service\n Staff here is friendly and professional, with front desk “check-in” happening at seated desks and a helpful concierge available to create a spa or wellness itinerary based on a guest’s preferences. Spa staff was also on-point with appointments running smoothly and explanations of the venue’s eclectic treatments.', 'For families\n Parents looking for a comfortable getaway will have lots of conveniences here, with the all-suite set-up (and grocery store across the street for quick needs). The two-story rock-climbing wall in the gym accommodates kids and is a fun option for families, but make sure to reserve in advance since the limited spots tend to fill up quickly (and private sessions can be pricey). The beach is well-maintained and the family pools are spacious and rarely crowded.', 'Accessibility\n Yes', 'Anything left to mention?\n If you’re looking forward to the fitness classes, it’s best to check the schedule before arrival and reserve any spots you may be interested in, as class sizes are now limited and smaller due to COVID restrictions.']","6801 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, Florida 33141, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/miami-beach/carillon-miami-beach,http://www.carillonhotel.com

As one of Miami Beach’s biggest hotels (there are nearly 800 rooms), the Loews attracts as diverse a clientele as Miami welcomes as visitors. Families with kids, couples with dogs, business travelers with laptops—everyone happily coexists and gets what they need from the hotel, which counts adults-only poolside cabanas, a beachfront location, and Rao's Miami Beach, an outpost of the popular Manhattan eatery, among its draws. While the hotel’s design is steeped in old-school Art Deco elements, their in-room amenities are cutting-edge; in addition to smart TVs, rooms are equipped with a doorbell that lets you switch the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on from inside the room.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nWhen the Loews Miami Beach Hotel first opened in 1998, it bucked an of-the-moment trend by becoming the first new hotel to be built in Miami Beach in more than 30 years. (Other “new” hotels were merely renovated old hotels.) Yet they didn't start completely from scratch: a 17-story tower was built around the St. Moritz, a 1939 Art Deco gem, to create a new hotel with history. Though the hotel completed a $50 million renovation in 2017, it still elicits that feeling of having one foot planted in the past and the other moving quickly toward the future."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nAs one of Miami Beach’s biggest hotels (there are nearly 800 rooms), the Loews attracts as diverse a clientele as Miami welcomes as visitors. Families with kids, couples with dogs, business travelers with laptops—everyone happily coexists and gets what they need from the hotel.', 'Importantly: Tell us about your room.\nThough any beachfront hotel worth its sand will give guests plenty of chances to gaze out at the ocean, it always seems to be worth the extra cost to choose an oceanfront room when you can—hence, our decision to book an Ocean Front Balcony Room. Overall, the room was pretty, with wood floors, ocean-inspired artwork, and a white and beige color scheme that doesn’t compete with the view. It’s a beach-chic design that’s elegant without trying too hard, though the furnished balcony is definitely the star of this show. The only issue we really had was that the walls seem pretty thin, so the noise level—while far from deafening—was a bit higher than we would have liked.', 'We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nLike so many other Loews locations, the hotel delivers when it comes to the mattress (a plush Stearns & Foster pillowtop variety). Frette duvets up the ante.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies. Any of that worth a mention?\nWhile the hotel’s design is steeped in old-school Art Deco elements, their in-room amenities are cutting-edge. In addition to smart TVs, rooms are equipped with a doorbell that lets you switch the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on from inside the room. No futzing around with a plastic door sign—or getting out of bed—required.', 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nThe marble bathrooms with walk-in showers are appropriately fancy, but nothing over the top. The ultra-soft Ultimate Doeskin robe by Chadsworth & Haig is a nice change from the standard terrycloth you’ll find at other hotels. Celebrity hairstylist Julien Farel is the man behind the products you’ll put on your head and face; you’re in good hands.', 'We all need some good Wi-Fi. What’s the word on that?\nWhile the Wi-Fi is \ntechnically\n free, it’s part of what’s included in the $38-a-night resort fee you’ll pay upon arrival, so not quite “free” after all. The connection itself was decent most of the time, though we did have a couple of quick drop-offs in service, which can be slightly frustrating if you’re on a working vacation.', ""What's there to eat and drink?\nIn addition to in-room dining there are also five food and beverage outlets at the hotel including the lounge Bar Collins on the ground floor with an inviting outdoor patio. But the main attraction is no doubt the newly-opened Rao’s outpost in the hotel’s St. Moritz Tower featuring southern Neapolitan Italian cooking including the legendary Rao’s Traditional Meatballs and Uncle Vincent’s Lemon Chicken, combined with contemporary dishes created specifically for the Miami location. While reservations are notoriously difficult to get, the hotel concierge strives to give hotel guests priority."", 'Did the staff make an impression?\nGiven the size of the hotel, and the number of guests staying here at any moment, the speed of the in-room dining team is impressive. That they always have a smile on their face is gold medal-worthy.', ""How's the spa?\n The hotel’s Sea Spa is a den of relaxation with amenities like steam bath, sauna and hot tubs as well as a massive ocean-facing fitness center. There’s a full schedule of fitness classes to take advantage of—from yoga to barre sculpt."", 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nAs part of its $50 million renovation, the hotel added a section of adults-only cabanas to its lavish SOAK pool club. Guests aged 21+ without kids in tow are welcome to reserve one of these poolside cabanas, which feature covered seating areas, a pair of lounge chairs, a round daybed, a dedicated concierge, and a large magazine section.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nIf you want to find a way to justify the cost of upgrading to an oceanfront room with a balcony, just think of it as an investment in your sanity. Being able to have a tiny bit of private space where we could soak up the sun and breathe fresh air was worth the added cost.', 'Bottom line: worth it?\nFor families with young children and guests traveling with four-legged friends, the Loews Miami Beach offers a beachfront location, ocean views, a wonderful beach club, and plenty of activities to keep every member of the family engaged. But it’s a large hotel, and often crowded—which is a good thing…unless total peace and quiet is the main thing on your to-do list.']","1601 Collins Ave., Miami, Florida 33139, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/miami/loews-miami-beach-hotel,http://www.loewshotels.com/Miami-Beach-Hotel

The namesake cocktail—a combination of Prosecco and white peach puree invented at Harry’s Bar in Venice in 1948—is a must-order, as are the fresh pastas and beautifully-composed dishes of langoustine carpaccio and veal scallopine.

The neighborhood is also perfect for families with plenty of parks and playgrounds sprinkled throughout its winding streets.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"In the quiet residential enclave of Surfside, ensconced between the skin-revealing glitter of Miami Beach proper and the buttoned-up flash of Bal Harbour, the Four Seasons Hotel at The Surf Club is a timeless and all-welcoming, new-fashioned take on old-school glamor. Opened in 2017, the hotel builds upon the illustrious circa 1931 beach club that hosted America’s most distinguished throughout the mid 20th century, including Gary Cooper, Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra, and Elizabeth Taylor, for fashion-forward parties, beach soirees, and alcohol-fueled overnights—epic enough to enshrine The Surf Club into Florida cultural history (and merit a standalone Assouline coffee-table book). Today, the beachfront legend continues with the resurrection of The Surf Club to its full Mediterranean Revival architectural glory, now enveloped by a series of three, 12-story modernist glass-framed towers. In 72 of the 77 guest rooms and suites in the new towers, glass balconies give way to soothing interiors by famed Paris-based creator Joseph Dirand, delivering design studies in midcentury modern updated for the present day, underscored by juxtapositions of travertine–finished spaces, clean-lined-yet-curvaceous hybrid furnishings, and tastefully gilded accents. (A similar style prevails in the five lower-level Ocean Bungalows, which occupy architect Russell T. Pancoast’s beach cabanas of yore.) The restored historic building oozes vintage glam from all corners, down to the black marble check-in desk (where a fully stocked complimentary Champagne cart awaits upon arrival) and Lido Restaurant and Champagne Bar, the Club’s former ballroom thoughtfully transformed into a drop-dead gorgeous, local-frequented Italian hotspot.

Home to some of the best restaurants in town, the most elegant bars, it feels like a breath of elegant air in a sometimes clubby Miami scene. Ascend the coral stone steps and enter its palm-filled, beamed lobby, and it might still be 1931—except that the buzz from the bar is a signal that prohibition has clearly been lifted.', ""Sounds like there's a backstory here...\n Back in the day, rum runners from Cuba and the Bahamas ensured the Surf Club rarely ran dry, so there was always a party in the cabanas here, drawing the likes of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Gary Cooper, Henry Ford, and John Harvey Kellogg. (Later, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner honeymooned here.) So put away the idea that Four Seasons is a faceless Canadian brand of business hotels; this place is practically a national landmark that has been transformed into a 21st century beacon of high-rise living by Richard Meier, with interiors by Joseph Dirand."", 'Importantly: Tell us about your room?\nExquisitely minimalist, calm and beautiful and so thoughtfully designed that you can see the sea from the shower. The category to choose is an Oceanfront room; they’re even lovelier than those in the double-aspect Premier category. The less expensive city-view category is great, too: they look across Biscayne Bay to mainland Miami, which offers the opportunity to see some striking sunsets.', 'What do we have for food and drink here?\n \nThe hotel’s main dining room is now Lido Restaurant (revamped from the opening Le Sirenuse concept) and helmed by Executive Chef Marco Calenzo and it specializes in Mediterranean cuisine with decadent pastas and grilled fish and steak. The setting for all this Italian bounty is the grandeur of The Surf Club’s fabled ballroom, once home to the 20th century’s most talked about parties and culinary affairs and now an arched mahogany dining room that gives way to the ocean views of the Lido Terrace. Thomas Keller’s Surf Club restaurant has earned a Michelin star tow years in a row and serves up top-notch throwback cooking with Lobster Thermidor and Beef Wellington in a polished jewel box of a dining room. It’s always busy, so reserve a table when you book your room.', 'How did you find the service?\n \nUnexpectedly international (my breakfast was brought by a Russian on Four Seasons’ fast-track management program) and reassuringly slick, as one has come to expect from the brand.', 'Who else is staying here?\nDespite three swimming pools and direct access to the beach, one senses the polished, well-heeled, outwardly conservative ‘business-casual’ clientele are mostly in town for meetings, at least midweek. (It may be less preppy on weekends.) The restaurant crowd—much of it local—glams up in the evening, but the \nFaena\n it isn’t.', 'What about the neighborhood? Are we in a notable location?\nCompared with South Beach (20 minutes south in an Uber), the Surfside area of northern Miami Beach is fairly dull, residential and lacking in shops and restaurants.', ""What's the one thing you'd change?\nThey shouldn’t—as they did when I stayed—levy a 20 percent service charge on the ‘admin fee’ of a room-service order as well as the food, bringing the cost of a modest breakfast (coffee, orange juice, and granola) to an astonishing $43.80, including sales tax (at least they didn’t add service to that), excluding the further ‘gratuity’ they solicit below."", 'Anything else of note?\nIf you’re waiting in the lobby, the photo-filled vitrines are an intriguing visual history of the place.', 'Bottom line: worth it?\nAs long as you don’t use room service, it’s a real treat.

The muted, uncluttered décor isn’t bursting with personality, but marble bathrooms add a touch of glamour (some even have jetted or whirlpool tubs), and things like internet-connected TVs, sofa beds (available in most of the categories), and kitchens complete with ovens and dishwashers (found in some suites) are useful for families.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n WiFi is complimentary both in the rooms and throughout the resort (but then again, you are paying a resort fee).', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n Grab breakfasts and lunches crafted with regionally sourced products at Corsair Kitchen & Bar (try to snag a table on the terrace), or dig into steak, seafood, and the 1,000 bottle-strong wine list at Bourbon Steak by Michael Mina. There are also a couple of casual, al fresco dining options around the pool and cabanas, a market-style spot for grab-and-go and deli-style options, a Starbucks, and a cocktail-forward lobby bar.', 'And the service?\n Given the number of rooms, the extensive facilities, and the fact that non-hotel guests can access the restaurants, golf courses, and pools (the latter with day passes), service can be inconsistent and the crowds large, depending on the time of year.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\n Families, golfers, and Marriott loyalty points users. The resort is also a popular staycation spot for South Florida residents.', ""What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n The shops and restaurants of the Aventura Mall are just a seven-minute walk away. Miami is a dozen miles down the road, you're not far from spots like Marlins Park Stadium and Zoo Miami. Activities like boating, jet-skiing, snorkeling, kayaking, and mountain biking can all be enjoyed within a five-mile radius. But most guests tend to stay put at the resort, as they’ve come for the on-site attractions."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\n Jostling for a poolside lounger can be an issue in the best of circumstances, but with the resort’s pools and on-site water park also open to day-pass guests (and no priorities given to hotel guests), it can be a particular issue here. Best to book a cabana—available for an extra fee—to ensure you’ve got a private spot."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n Room rates include admission to the Tidal Cove Waterpark, which features aquatic fun like a lazy river, kids cove, seven water slides, and an area for FlowRider lessons. The resort does have an adults-only pool, too; it’s not all that less crowded, but you can find some quiet in one of the 25 cabanas available to book (for an additional fee). Golfers come for the two renowned 18-hole championship courses, both originally designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., and the site of numerous PGA tournaments, while the three-story wellness area features a huge gym, a center for integrative and holistic medicine, fitness programs, and a spa offering Babor treatments and Himalayan salt rooms. Shuttles ferry guests to the beach about two miles away.', 'Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\n A convenient getaway that keeps kids, adults, and golfers entertained. Particularly worth it if you’ve got Marriott points to spend, as all the extras, from resort fees to activity charges, can add up.']","19999 W Country Club Dr., Miami, Florida 33180, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/miami/turnberry-isle-miami,http://www.turnberryislemiami.com/

In a city with no shortage of fantastic boutique hotels, this Four Seasons offers a luxury experience that takes style and comfort to a whole new level.', 'The rooms', 'Think: your most fabulous friend’s spacious Parisian pied-a-terre (after all, this is a city that prides itself on Francophone connections). The details are gorgeous without being overwhelming or overly precious: with herringbone wood floors, stunning custom furniture pieces, and positively enormous marble bathrooms with heavenly Byredo amenities. It’s worth calling out the truly fantastic, spacious closets; they are beautifully lit, feature well-constructed built-in drawers, and have enough space to hide your luggage away, lending each room and suite a residential feel where you’ll almost forget you’re staying in a hotel. Every key here is fabulous, but our advice is to request one of the higher level rooms for more optimized views, as the lower level views partially overlook the parking lot across the street.', 'Food and drink', 'Celebrity chef Marcus Samuellsson leads the way with the signature Marcus Restaurant + Terrace, as well as a distinct Marcus Lounge + Bar space. The sprawling restaurant uses solarium-style windows to flood the space with natural light by day and twinkling city lights by night, and the lounge space is a sexy mixology concept that has, in this hotel’s relatively short time being open, already become one of the best places in downtown Montreal to meet for a drink. And of course, this being a Four Seasons, don’t sleep on the inspired 24-hour in-room dining menu, either; there’s even a 15-minute minute menu for those in a rush, as well as a dedicated plant-based menu to accommodate a range of dietary preferences.', 'The spa', 'Montreal’s downtown spa scene has left something to be desired for a number of years, but the Four Season’s Guerlain Spa gets everything right:\xa0 the robes are plush, the treatments transformative, and therapists are wonderfully unhurried. It’s truly an urban sanctuary where you’ll forget the city outside. Make sure to pencil in plenty of time before or after your treatment to luxuriate in the hydrotherapy room; this is only urban spa in Montreal to offer a Kneipp Hydrotherapy Experience, a trail of polished stones inlaid in the floor to stimulate acupressure points on the soles of the feet, followed by a refreshing wading pool.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The hotel is in the heart of downtown, walking distance to all the major attractions–and even offers a direct entrance into neighboring Holt Renfrew Ogilvy.', 'The service', 'Ask, and you shall receive. The Four Seasons concierge team is here to make your stay seamless.', 'Eco Effort', 'Sustainability permeates every aspect of your stay–from the electric vehicle charging stations out front, to the energy-saving guest room controls, to the elimination of single-use plastics and an organic waste diversion and eco-certified cleaning programs in place.', 'Accessibility', 'The hotel is fully accessible, with wide doorways, accessible rooms available, and elevator access to every level.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'It’s so easy for global hotel brands to arrive in a new city, rely on the same old formulas that have made them successful elsewhere, and expect people to show up–but this Four Seasons really captures the cosmopolitan, French-inflected spirit of this city. Sure, it will cost you. But when you stay at a Four Seasons, the service and amenities you’re enjoying more than pick up the slack.']","1440 Rue de la Montagne, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Z5, Canada",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/montreal/four-seasons-hotel-montreal,https://www.fourseasons.com/montreal/

1 Hotel Nashville,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"A stay at 1 Hotel Nashville is a sensory experience, from the tactile—with textured, reclaimed wood, and live plants on many surfaces—to the scent—which is closer to a field of wildflowers in the countryside than a busy city block in the heart of honky-tonk action. The Nashville branch of the 1 Hotel chain, which opened in 2022, is representative of the brand’s commitment to sustainability, in a way that is engaging but not spartan or schoolmarmish. Devote time to exploring some of these choices, such as the hourglass in the shower to create awareness about the length of time you leave the water running, and the hangers in the closet made from recycled wrapping paper. Like all proper Nashville hotels, 1 Hotel has a rooftop bar with a view; this one is surrounded in the hotel’s signature greenery, contributing to the feeling that country and city co-exist. And they do it on a plush bed with organic cotton sheets.","['Why book?', 'Nashville’s brightest lights and loudest sounds co-exist with nature’s essence in a hotel that is built on a foundation of sustainability.', 'Set the scene', 'If the city of Tulum, Mexico were picked up and put in a hotel lobby in Nashville, it might feel like 1 Hotel Nashville. The space has a laid-back, eco-forward vibe, with live plants around and architectural elements that evoke Tennessee barns without being farmhouse style or kitschy. A long table on the way to the elevators offers a “farm stand” of fresh, if imperfect, fruits for a snack which well-heeled, casually dressed guests (many in natural fibers) appreciate. It is not unusual to see guests with dogs in tow.', 'The backstory', 'Started in 2015, the 1 Hotel chain is focused on a luxury eco-friendly experience. The hotels are rooted in biophilic design, connecting the building to nature. In Nashville that means live greenery along its outdoor façade and indoors, and a large art installation features every invasive plant in Tennessee, plus living plants in every guest room.', 'The rooms', 'The hotel’s sustainable, paperless mission is evident in the guest rooms. Instead of a pad of paper, you’ll find a chalkboard. Instead of plastic water bottles, grab a reusable bottle and use the in-room filtered water tap. Don’t want any interruptions? Place the Do Not Disturb rock in the hallway. But being sustainable doesn’t mean lack of luxury. Each room has live plants (watered by staff), plush bedding (organic cotton fibers, of course), and rain showers. The aesthetic is framed by reclaimed wood, exposed beams, and floor-to-ceiling windows.', 'Food and drink', 'Former “Top Chef” contestant Chris Crary helms 1 Kitchen, the hotel’s signature first-floor restaurant. The sustainability principles throughout the hotel are on display here, with an emphasis on local and seasonal ingredients (the goal is for 75 percent of ingredients to come from within a 200-mile radius). Look for regional produce like pawpaws on the menu. Trout from area purveyors is delivered in a cooler, not in plastic wrap. The kitchen doesn’t even have a printer: orders are communicated digitally. Harriet’s Rooftop is the 21-and-older rooftop bar, surrounded in more greenery. It’s the place to go for a crafted cocktail while looking out on the city skyline. Smoothies and other grab-and-go healthy breakfast, lunch, and snack items are available from the small Neighbors café in the lobby.', 'The spa', 'Walking into the Bamford Wellness Spa smells like walking into a meadow in the rain, thanks to the signature natural products used in all the spa treatments. While enveloped in scent you can unplug in a relaxation room which also has a greenery-clad balcony looking out on Nashville city streets, somehow both connecting you from the city and helping you feel far away from it. Treatments run the gamut from massages to facials to Vitamin B12 injections and antioxidant infusions.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'SoBro is a dynamic part of downtown, home to the Music City Center convention complex across the street and just blocks from the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. This is one of Nashville’s densest urban areas, and it will be particularly crowded when there are events at nearby Bridgestone Arena. The hotel is blocks from the neon of Broadway and its honkytonks, as well as attractions such as the Frist Art Museum and Gibson Garage.', 'The service', 'Not only will the staff immediately remember your name, they’ll remember the name of your dog, where you’re traveling from and other details to make you feel like you know one another. Service is polite and friendly and helpful, but not overbearing.', 'Eco effort', 'Not happy with Nashville’s options for glass recycling, the hotel installed its own glass crusher to recycle the glass waste it generates. Rooms keys are wooden, in-room carafes are made from old wine bottles, and even the hangers are made from recycled paper. The 1 Less Thing program allows you to leave unwanted clothing to be donated to a local organization. An hourglass in the shower helps you track how long your showers are—and therefore how much water you are using—in an unobtrusive way.', 'Accessibility', 'Entrances, guest rooms, restaurants, the lobby, meeting space and the fitness center meet ADA standards.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'Check schedules for the Supper That Sustains Us, a family-style dinner series that focuses on the restaurant’s sustainability mission with the opportunity to meet other guests as well as the hotel chefs.

Southall Farm & Inn,,3,"Southall Farm and Inn feels all of the 25 miles away from the hubbub of Nashville’s neon-lit honkytonk scene. In fact, its 325 acres feel like a different world entirely. This bucolic setting is a sustainable oasis designed for your resort-style immersion experience. You’ll abandon your car on arrival and instead get around on foot, bike, ATV, or by staff-driven golf cart, allowing you to explore the property at a leisurely pace. Soak in the plunge pool, get centered in a sound bath, take the kids for a zipline, eat s’mores on the deck of your cottage, and never once leave the property. (Although, if you choose to, historic downtown Franklin is less than four miles away.) Amenities are designed to make the most of the land and preserve its natural beauty. Take time to notice the details, such as custom wallpaper, glazed clay plates, and freshly cut flowers.","['Why book?', 'Southall is an experience unto itself—with 325 acres of rolling Middle Tennessee hills, impeccable service, and every imaginable amenity—designed as a destination on its own, not a place to sleep while entertaining yourself elsewhere.', 'Set the scene', 'Nestled in historic Franklin, 25 miles south of downtown Nashville, Southall is a sustainable getaway from Music City. As soon as you enter the property’s gates, you’ll leave your car. For the entirety of your stay you’ll walk, bike, borrow an ATV, or be shuttled in a cart. This car-less experience contributes to the bucolic experience of the environs. The crowd here has an easy elegance: folks who came to Nashville on business first and this is the casual portion of the trip. Couple and family getaways, wedding guests, anyone could be wandering along the paths. But you might not see them. Even when most of the rooms are booked at Southall, thanks to its design you feel like you have a resort of your own.', 'The backstory', 'On what was unremarked upon farmland a few years ago, Southall was built from the ground up, now with 16 different guest cottages, an inn, a restaurant (with a second in the works), a spa, a pool, an orchard, greenhouses, farm stands, gardens, hiking trails, beekeeping facilities, demonstration kitchens, and more, all with an eye toward sustainable use. For example, the pond (called Lake Mishkin) was needed to irrigate that orchard. So, it is used for complimentary kayaking and paddleboarding.', 'The rooms', 'The cottages on the hillside are cleverly designed, so despite being relatively close to one another, you can’t hear or see the folks next door. Instead you can soak in a giant bathtub, looking out on the trees, or sit on your porch swing or in your screened-in porch. Rooms in the inn may be in a more traditional hotel format, but they are no less luxurious. Soaker bathtubs, gas fireplaces, sofas for curling up with a good book are found here, too. Check out the custom-made wallpaper; it’s designed to mimic the scenery out the window.', 'Food and drink', 'Southall is a working farm first, so the majority of ingredients on the plate are grown on premises, including in one of two greenhouses that make it possible to grow citrus and other more tropical fruits and herbs in Tennessee. Local honey and jams are made on-site; you can participate in classes and tastings. Most meals are taken at Sojourner, the three-meals-a-day option, cooking up Southall-raised eggs for breakfast and seasonal entrees with local vegetables at night under the direction of Executive Chef Andrew Klamar. Room service is available (delivered in the golf cart) if you prefer to eat on your cottage porch, and you’ll get a live potted plant to admire on your tray. A fine dining restaurant, January, is in the works.', 'The spa', 'Like all of Southall, the spa is an oasis of calm. Connected to the main lodge, it features traditional spa treatment rooms and gender-segregated locker rooms. An unusual treat is the co-ed soaking pool, overlooking Lake Mishkin, which allows families to plunge and relax together before or after their treatments, which run the gamut from massage to sound bath to tea ceremonies. Many of the botanicals used in the medicinal treatments are grown onsite.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'While Southall is just four miles from historic downtown Franklin, it is designed to feel like there’s nothing else around. From the moment you enter the gates, your experience is Southall-centric. The only neighbors you’ll see are the birds and the only traffic is the staff golf carts unless you choose to leave the property.', 'The service', 'Whatever you need, you can get at Southall; there’s a team of attentive staff who know your name and will be there to make it happen, whether you want s’mores supplies for your fire pit, a ride to the zipline course, or a dinner reservation. While the staff is professional and ubiquitous (even during national staffing shortages), they are not formal, and you get the laid-back vibes of being at your summer house in the mountains…if your summer house was 325 acres.', 'For families', 'Many of the planned activities, including the aerial course and ziplining, jam- and honey-tasting classes,\xa0falconry, fly fishing, ATV experiences, and guided hikes are designed to do with or without kids. Southall is the kind of resort where you can have some quality time with the kids, enjoying experiences instead of screens. But if you are traveling without your kids, you won’t feel surrounded by other people’s families. Couples-time and family-friendly activities co-exist well here.', 'Eco effort', 'Southall is trying to walk the talk when it comes to sustainability, from removing invasive species of plants on the property to seed saving to composting. Tours of the land, with explanations of the conservation efforts, are available for interested guests.', 'Accessibility', 'The property meets ADA standards. Some cottages and hiking trails may not be as accessible as others. Discuss any concerns before booking specific rooms.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'Southall is a resort unlike others, luxury and casual at the same time, of Tennessee but also of the world. No detail has been overlooked. If you get parched while walking the trails, pop into a resting station with bathrooms, coffee, water, snacks, books, and magazines.']","2200 Osage Lp, Franklin, Tennessee 37064, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/franklin/southall-farm-and-inn,https://southalltn.com/
Graduate Nashville,,2,"Travel should be fun and the Graduate knows that. They incorporated cheeky, quirky art elements and attractions throughout the moderately priced hotel near the Vanderbilt University campus. You can belt out your favorite karaoke tunes while being accompanied by an animatronic band at Cross-Eyed Critters or go to the rooftop and take a photo with a giant, pink chicken-wire bust of Dolly Parton. While some of the details may seem offbeat, the hotel takes making sure you get a good night’s rest seriously. Rooms are ample in size and comfortable, with well-appointed bedding and plush carpet to cushion your walk after a night on the town. For all the good-time-vacationers who stay here, rooms are adequately soundproof. They can party and you can sleep. Or vice versa.","['Why book?', 'This is the upbeat, set-the-email-to-out-of-office weekend away hotel choice, an art-filled place with something quirky in every corner.', 'Set the scene', 'If you haven’t heard that Nashville is a destination for bachelorette parties, you’ll find out when you book a room at the Graduate Nashville. The lobby teams with cowboy-hat-wearing groups of women taking photos with the cool art in the lobby and making plans to head out on the town. Like all Graduate hotels, the lobby is designed for hanging out, so you may see students pouring over books, locals reading in the ample living room-style chairs, or families planning where to go grab barbecue.', 'The backstory', 'Graduate hotels are built in college towns, and purposefully fuse the personalities of nearby campuses with other iconic city elements. No two Graduate hotels are exactly alike. In Knoxville, you’ll find photos of Peyton Manning in the rooms. In Nashville, it’s a portrait of Dolly Parton hung over the bed. There are little Easter eggs hidden throughout, such as elements of the Tennessee flag and Vanderbilt University’s acorns in the carpet design. The Nashville outpost is just feet away from Vanderbilt University and not far from Belmont University and other schools. Vanderbilt’s essence is woven into the décor, including a piece of art by the front door that details every different tree found on the Vanderbilt campus, which is a certified arboretum.', 'The rooms', 'Like the rest of the hotel, guest rooms have fun detailing that is a nod to both Nashville and Vanderbilt. Rumor is that the Vanderbilt campus is home to three squirrels for every student, so you’ll see squirrel-shaped door pulls. Four-poster beds have a decorative canopy that includes a painting of Dolly Parton. Plush, colorful carpet, pink striped wallpaper, and full-length curtains complete a look that is heavy on Southern charm. Big spenders can book the 9-to-5 Suite which doubles down on all things Dolly and has great views of Midtown, but the suite life isn’t essentially for getting the vibe. Rooms are ample in size (plenty of room to walk around your bed and desk, but not huge) and have a small fridge for keeping beer cold.', 'Food and drink', 'White Limozeen (named after a Dolly Parton album) is the Graduate Nashville’s rooftop bar and its most-photographed spot (that’s saying a lot in a hotel where every corner is photoworthy). Non-hotel-guests flock here to have cocktails, see the giant pink bust of Dolly Parton, and be photographed with its pink-and-white poolside umbrellas. Reservations are a must to eat and drink at White Limozeen. The full menu features seafood dishes and salads, and the prettiest cocktails you can imagine, plus a full brunch and a limited poolside menu. On the first floor, at Cross-Eyed Critters animatronic creatures accompany you on stage as you sing your heart out at karaoke. The food menu here is limited to tacos, burgers, chips and salsa and the like, plus all manner of spirits, beer, wine. This is a 21-and-older popular destination for bachelorette parties and other groups. The space is dark and clubby, but don’t let that stop you from wandering and taking in the fun Nashville-music themed décor. Grab a cup of coffee and pastries at Poindexter Coffee, the coffee shop in the lobby. Don’t miss the pencils which are used as an art element built into the sides of the coffee counter.', 'The spa', 'The hotel does not have a spa. There is a pool on the rooftop; everyone needs a reservation to use the pool, guests and non-guests alike.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The Graduate Midtown location can seem sleepy sometimes of the year, but it is just a few blocks from a lot of different action. Across the street is the Vanderbilt University campus and surrounding student-centric restaurants and bars. Elliston Place is Nashville’s famous “Rock Block” with the Exit/In music venue, a famous soda shop, and boutiques and restaurants. It’s a mile-and-a-half straight shot to Lower Broad and Nashville honkytonks.', 'The service', 'Many Graduate hotels staff students on its properties. At the reception desk you’ll learn about the majors and interests of those working that day. Staff is friendly and enthusiastic (particularly if you are traveling with your dog; expect extra treats and pets), but they are not hospitality professionals with decades of experience. They’re happy to help you with area recommendations and fix anything that might have gone wrong, but if you like someone to call you by name and roll out the red carpet, this might not be your jam. Self-service bicycles are at your disposal and valet service is quick and convenient.', 'For families\n.', 'The hotel is dog-friendly with a $35 fee. Guests with dogs will be asked to fill out a safety form on check-in and will be given a special pet-in-room sign for their door.', 'Accessibility', 'Because this is a new building, and not a retrofitted old one it is ADA accessible, from the guest rooms, to the doors and the ample-sized elevators.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'Obviously, if you’re in Nashville, you want to spend plenty of time exploring Nashville. But it is worth setting aside some time to hang out in the hotel if you’ve booked here, particularly if you are an art fan. The owners have made a concerted effort to acquire pieces from artists in Nashville and about Nashville.

Conrad Nashville,,2,"It’s easy to imagine a movie being filmed in the large, high-ceiled, light-filled lobby of the Conrad. With its sweeping staircase and nattily-dressed clientele, it feels like it is out of central casting for “luxury hotel.” This vibe of everything being just right permeates the experience of staying at the Conrad. From wise assistance from the concierge to make the most of time in town, to dinner at Blue Aster, capping off the day with an artfully prepared meal, to a long soak in a giant bathtub, to getting shut-eye by closing the blinds with a press of a button, a stay at the Conrad is designed to make your life easier. The Midtown location is close enough to the Ryman Auditorium, Lower Broadway, and other attractions to get there quickly, but also offers a respite from downtown congestion.","['Why book?', 'In an age of kitsch, there’s something compelling about a straight-up traditional luxury hotel, with no artifice and no gimmicks—just gleaming floors and welcoming staff.', 'Set the scene', 'The extra-high ceilings, sweeping staircase, and horseshoe-shaped motor entrance combine to make the Conrad’s lobby feel like a sleek, big-city hotel where you rush in to drop off your packages from a day of shopping before running out to the theater. While Conrad guests, of course, are doing all the Music City things, from honky tonk hopping to book shopping, the vibe is more refined than many of the other \nNashville\n hotel options.

Inside the room you’ll find the best uses of technology, including buttons that open and close sheer curtains and blackout shades.

The restaurant, Yolan, could bring you to Nashville all on its own—heck, it brought Spiaggia's Tony and Cathy Mantuano. They moved to Nashville to open at the Joseph, bringing world-renowned pasta, hand-blown wine glasses, and building a see-through cheese cave with 80-pound wheels. In a generous move, the hotel also opened up the best real estate in the building, next to the Penthouse, to everyone by putting the fitness center there. That means every guest can appreciate the best view in the place.   ","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention?

Each floor has different wallpaper in the hallways, each one custom made by a Tennessee artist.

This is a giant complex—one of the largest hotels without a casino anywhere in the world. So, you could spend you whole vacation there, whizzing down slides in the SoundWaves waterpark, checking out the nightly light shows in the atrium, eating next to an indoor waterfall, admiring the plants in the conservatory, and then walking across the parking lot to catch a show at the Grand Ole Opry. That’s not recommended, of course—to love Nashville is to see all of it—but Opryland is a fun destination that connects R&R with the city’s musical history. Rooms are comfortable with pillow-top mattresses and plenty of elbow room. Book an atrium room with a balcony looking out into the resort.","['Why book?\n\xa0Gaylord Opryland thematically celebrates \nNashville\n’s country music traditions from the city’s only resort, complete with everything a resort offers: lots of restaurants, bars, pools, shops, entertainment, and even an indoor light show.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0Gaylord Opryland is one of the largest hotel complexes without a casino anywhere in the world. Its size and family-friendly and convention-friendly vibe, give it a buzzy energy all year. The hotel is centered around a giant atrium—the complex has its own nursery to fill it with plants—so it is always warm and sunny inside, even when it is winter outside. You can dine by a waterfall or take an indoor boat ride and take an indoor stroll.', 'The backstory\n\xa0Gaylord Opryland was once the hotel next to the Opryland U.S.A. theme park. The parks closed in 1997, and the hotel has continued to expand, adding more performance spaces, convention and meeting rooms, restaurants, pools, a golf course, and attractions. The resort was closed for renovation for several months after the 2010 flood.', 'The rooms\n\xa0Renovated rooms are updated with a clean, minimal but comfortable design. The classic simplicity of the rooms allows you to appreciate all of the extra vibe throughout the hotel without having sensory overload. Pay the extra for a room that opens to the atrium. Those rooms have balconies and views of all the indoor plants, the light shows, and the whole Gaylord vibe. You’ll likely hear music and even the rush of the indoor waterfall. Rooms are spacious enough for extra rollaway cots or cribs. Some suites also have extra Murphy beds.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0The resort has an extraordinary number of restaurants under its glass roof, ranging from casual pizza and burgers to the Old Hickory Steakhouse which grows some of its herbs inside the atrium. Fuse Sports Bar has more than 100 TVs to catch whichever game is your thing. Ravello serves Italian food with views inside the garden conservatory while Falls Bar & Lounge is nestled next to the indoor waterfall. Room service is available 24-7 and poolside drinks and dining are available both at the traditional swimming pools and in the SoundWaves water park.', 'The spa\n\xa0Relache Spa offers the standard spa and salon treatments from a quiet oasis of the active resort, ranging from massages to facials to manicures and pedicures. There are a few specialty offerings, such as CBD-infused massages, but the emphasis is on classic relaxation. The spa includes a relaxation room and steam room. The spa is open to non-hotel guests and the session also gives access to the fitness room and one of the swimming pools.', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0Called Music Valley, Opryland is the cornerstone of the area, which is also home to the Grand Ole Opry, the Opry Mills mall, and a collection of small, but groovy boutiques, antique stores and music venues. It doesn’t have a neighborhood feel in that Music Valley isn’t residential and there are not charming blocks to stroll. The Opryland complex, with its parking lot, takes up a lot of the area.', 'The service\n\xa0Gaylord staff have a phrase: “Consider it done,” and for the most part, any request can be accommodated. The concierge is particularly helpful with other Gaylord properties, such as the Ryman Auditorium, General Jackson, and the Grand Ole Opry, but can assist with tickets and information on other Nashville attractions. Because of the resort’s mammoth size, it may take a few minutes for something to be delivered to your room. Service is polite and accommodating, and the staff is well-trained, but Gaylord Opryland isn’t a luxury resort, so don’t expect the red-carpet treatment unless you are a V.I.P. or have Marriott Rewards status. The resort is also home to a convention center. That area tends to have its own staff and conventions don’t cause service back-ups in the rest of the hotel.', 'For families\n\xa0The entire ethos of Gaylord Opryland is to be family friendly. One all-ages highlight is SoundWaves, a massive indoor-outdoor waterpark with slides, a wave pool, a lazy river, cabanas and its own restaurants. Packages with Soundwaves included should be best purchased when making room reservations. During the winter holidays, Opryland is transformed into a “country Christmas” wonderland with ice sculptures, ice skating, live musical performances, scavenger hunts and more holiday lights than even Santa’s elves could count. Like any resort, there are plenty of poolside activities, menu items, and gift shop distractions for kids.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0The resort’s large size can make it hard to walk for people with limited mobility, but Gaylord provides a full-service accessibility guide, including a resort map with accessibility routes, wheelchair and scooter rental, accessible shuttle transportation, plus ADA-standards on accessible rooms, restaurants, pools, and other attractions.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0Check out the recording booth for WSM radio near the Delta lobby.

That year the hotel also kicked off a complete renovation of guest rooms, the lobby, bar, and restaurant, resulting in a look that is crisp and modern but still connects to the hotel’s considerable history.

Its proximity to the state capitol building has meant it was long a convenient place for people to go to try to find their legislators. When the fight for women’s right to vote through the 19\nth\n amendment was waged, parties both for and against the efforts had their headquarters in the hotel. Since the 100\nth\n anniversary of the amendment, the hotel has leaned into that history, creating displays of artifacts throughout the hotel.', 'The rooms', 'At an average of 500 square feet per room, the Hermitage Hotel offers more space than other downtown stays. The entire hotel has been completely renovated. Guest room still have historic details, such as crown molding and marble bathrooms, that are appropriate for the period era of the hotel, but completely modernized with clean furniture lines, in-mirror televisions, and state-of-the-art technology. Look for luxury amenities and touches, such as stationery with your name printed on it, and plus robes for your post-shower or bath lounging.', 'Food and drink', 'In 2021 Celebrity Chef Jean-George Vongerichten opened his first restaurant in the South at the Hermitage, after overseeing a complete overhaul of the lower-level restaurant and its historic bar. The new spaces have the same feel as the spaces which have been go-tos for the city’s movers and shakers for decades, but updated with cleaner lines, brighter colors, and a more open feel. The restaurant, Drusie & Darr, is named of the children of the former manager of the hotel, who lived and grew up in the building. The menu relies on Vongerichten’s classic techniques made with Tennessee-grown ingredients.', 'The spa', 'The hotel does not currently have a full-service spa, but the concierge can arrange on-site massages and other services in a private area near the fitness center.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Across the street from the Tennessee Performing Arts Center and the Tennessee State Capitol building, this part of downtown is busy and bustling, but with a different vibe from the honkytonks on Broadway, just a few blocks away. You’ll find plenty of restaurants, a few bars, and small green spaces on your way to the city’s major attractions.', 'The service', 'The Hermitage was Nashville’s “first million-dollar hotel” and in the century since it opened it has maintained the level of service that a moniker like that deserves. Staff, from the concierge to the bellmen, are attentive and omnipresent, and will take care of anything you need. Efforts in recent years have made the service a little less formal (including changing staff uniforms) to adjust to changing expectations of modern travelers.', 'For families', 'Upstairs you can enjoy a traditional afternoon tea with scones and sandwiches under a restored painted ceiling; a pastime that is particularly popular as a mother-daughter outing.', 'Accessibility', 'The hotel meets\xa0ADA standards, with elevators and some accessible. As is the case with any historic building, some entrances have been retrofit to improve accessibility, and the process isn’t always as seamless as it is in a new-construction building. Check with staff when making reservations if you have specific concerns.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'Staff wear uniforms designed by Draper James, the brand from local hometown favorite Reese Witherspoon. The pattern includes yellow flowers, which were worn by the suffragists who fought for the 19\nth\n amendment at the Hermitage. Items with this pattern are also available in the gift shop.']","231 6th Ave. N., Nashville, Tennessee 37219, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/nashville/the-hermitage-hotel,http://www.thehermitagehotel.com/
Aman New York,"Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"In the 35 years since Aman was founded and its first property opened its doors in Phuket, the brand has come to represent a certain kind of experience for a certain kind of traveler: discreet, expansive, and intimate, with a full-bodied approach to wellness and an almost chameleon-like ability to adapt to the surrounding landscape. So it goes with Aman New York, the latest jewel in its crown—the brand’s very first urban outpost in the United States, and only its second urban property in the world after Aman Tokyo. And what a crown it is: Taking up residence in Midtown Manhattan’s iconic Crown Building, a Beaux-Arts landmark carefully renovated with Belgian designer Jean-Michel Gathy of Denniston Architects, the space dazzles with a 7,000-square-foot outdoor terrace, a spa and wellness center spread over three floors, and serene, high-ceilinged guest suites (each with its own fireplace).","['Why book?\n Like an exhale in the middle of Midtown Manhattan, this princely landmark building-turned-polished urban oasis places you right in the thick of things—and allows you to quietly retreat from it just as easily, with a sprawling, three-floor spa, serene, Japanese- and Southeast-Asian-influenced suites, and no shortage of space.', ""Set the scene\n If \nNew York\n sometimes feels like the center of the world, then Aman New York is the bull’s eye. Set on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, right around the corner from Billionaires Row, its location—the iconic Crown Building, circa 1921—is one of the city’s finest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture, a landmark building that, until 1932, housed the first iteration of the \nMuseum of Modern Art\n, and some of the city’s most coveted (and pricey) retail spaces thereafter. In its transition to an Aman property, it's likely that little has changed about its clientele—except that now, they're probably already Aman junkies, self-described devotees of the brand who flock to its properties wherever they vacation, from Greece to Wyoming. This is a well-heeled crowd that expects the highest level of everything, from food to design and service, but prefer it dispensed without pomp, circumstance, or flash. It’s clear that these patrons, outfitted in sharp Brunello Cucinelli suits and chic Prada shirt dresses, could lay their heads (and their wallets) wherever they’d like, but they’ve chosen the Aman precisely for its brand of unshowy but deeply luxurious hospitality."", ""The backstory\n In the 34 years since Aman was founded, and its first property opened its doors in Phuket, the brand has come to represent a certain kind of experience for a certain kind of traveler: discreet, expansive, and intimate, with a full-bodied approach to wellness and an almost chameleon-like ability to adapt to the surrounding landscape. So it goes with Aman New York, the latest jewel in its crown—the brand’s very first urban outpost in the United States, and only its second urban property in the world after \nAman Tokyo\n. (It’s also the launch property for the brand-new, members-only Aman Club, as well as the brand's first batch of urban residences.) And what a crown it is, taking up residence in the iconic Crown Building, a Beaux-Arts landmark carefully renovated with Belgian designer Jean-Michel Gathy of Denniston Architects. Aman’s talent lies in the seamless integration of its properties into its immediate environment—so it’s little surprise that even in bustling, over-the-top, loud, bright Midtown Manhattan, within the walls of this century-old icon, it’s managed to seamlessly integrate Aman’s understated, heavily Japanese-influenced minimalism, and by Gathy’s direction, to ensure that even at 14 floors up, the elements can be found everywhere: bubbling water features temper the near-omniscience of fire—there’s seemingly a fireplace behind every corner—while its breezy spaces, including its grand, double-height atrium and 7,000-square-foot, all-season outdoor terrace invoke air and earth together, thanks to abundant greenery. (Here, too, the plant life nods to the brand’s Asian roots, including bonsai trees and Japanese and Canadian maples, while ikebana arrangements are scattered throughout the property.)"", 'The rooms\n If each phase of the Aman New York experience feels like the next step in an elaborate nesting process—from entering the quiet, ground-floor foyer that immediately removes you from the frenetic pace of Midtown Manhattan, to the expansive, light-filled 14th-floor atrium you’re spirited up to—then walking down the hotel’s hushed, cream-colored hallways and reaching your suite feels like making it to the inner sanctum. There are only 83 suites total, and true to Aman’s ethos of generous space, they’re all positively groaning with it, at least by New York standards, ranging from 775 to 2,770 square feet, with nearly 11-foot-high ceilings that allow everything—including the guest—ample room to breathe. I stayed in a Premier Suite on the ninth floor, which faced onto 57th Street. The first thing I registered was the sound, or lack thereof. Thanks to the heavily soundproofed windows, the honks and shouts of the city below felt a million miles away. The second thing I clocked was the working fireplace, which, in an impressive New York first, each of the building’s 83 suites and 22 residences are outfitted with. I love a fireplace, and this one lent a quiet warmth to the space, which in keeping with Aman’s general design ethos was otherwise minimal and clean, rendered in natural materials like stone and wood, and shades of oatmeal and slate, cream and black. Many of the elements reflected a distinctly Japanese sensibility: the textured paneling behind the bed that resembled a shoji screen, for instance, and woven detailing beneath it that called to mind traditional tatami mats—not to mention the delicate, ink-painted washi paper mural running along one wall, inspired by the 15th-century masterpiece “Pine Trees” (Shōrin-zu byōbu) by Hasegawa Tōhaku.', 'Whatever the sense of calm imparted by the aesthetics, though, it was undergirded by smart, seamless technology: a tablet that controlled everything from the lighting to the shades and fireplace, and even the television, which disappeared discreetly into a console when switched off. There were no excesses, no distractions; even in dizzying Manhattan, I felt calm—serene, even—as I laid in the oversize king bed. The bedroom and bathroom are divided by a set of pivoting panels (which are backlit, and inlaid with intricately detailed rice paper panels) that can flip open and shut to varying degrees, allowing you to moderate the flow and movement between spaces. (These in particular are inspired by South Asian designs—from Bali, Indonesia, and Thailand—where homes are open to the outside.) In the bathroom, both the shower and standalone bathtub—the former, a small room kitted out in black stone and multiple showerheads, and the latter, like one ginormous half of a cracked eggshell—were massive. Of course, there were the requisite oversize Frette towels and robes, and thoughtful amenities like a Dyson hair dryer, and extra toothpaste, razors, and shaving cream, but the heated floors in the bathroom were perhaps my favorite surprise. Rates from $3,200 per night.', 'Food and drink\n I ate breakfast and lunch at Arva, Aman’s signature Italian restaurant, led by chef de cuisine Dario Ossolo (formerly the executive chef at Aman Venice), and found both meals to be lovely; the dishes—a silky yellowtail crudo, perfectly tender lamb chops in a rich but not heavy sauce, a carefully folded Florentine omelette—typified the hotel’s hyper-polished restraint.', 'Although the space itself was beautiful, cast in plenty of sunlight with a clean, yet grounded design, I wish I’d eaten one of those meals, or at least a snack, on the sprawling Garden Terrace outside. (The terrace is apportioned into a few areas, nearly all of which flow into one another. There’s the outdoor seating area for Arva, and around the corner is the open seating area off of the lobby, where guests can sit and have a drink from the Bar Lounge; cordoned off next to that is the members club-only space. Nama will also have its own designated outdoor dining space.)', 'What with all that covetable—and rare—outdoor space in Midtown, it felt like a missed opportunity. I headed down to the subterranean Jazz Club for an evening show, led by the virtuosic musician Brian Newman (currently the bandleader and arranger for the jazz and piano show at Lady Gaga’s Las Vegas residency), and knocked back a few of the bar’s exquisite martinis, and made dinner a room service affair. And I’m glad I did: the dining cart, with its white linen-covered warming trays, was rolled in with more than a hint of midcentury panache—and then I was given the full room-service work up, a performance all its own: a white tablecloth spread across my two-seat bistro table, with a perfectly cooked burger unveiled from beneath a cloche and a premixed martini poured into a chilled glass.', 'A Japanese restaurant, Nama, is also forthcoming by the end of the month. Its opening was delayed slightly, I learned, by the omakase countertop, and specifically, the procurement of hinoki wood that, according to their three-Michelin-star Japanese chef at Aman Tokyo, is a requirement for a true omakase experience.', 'The Jazz Club is open to the public, and initially, Arva and Nama will be in a preview period, open only to hotel guests, club members, and residence owners; the hotel plans to open them both on a reservation-only basis to outside guests if availability allows.', 'The spa\n Spread across three floors and roughly 25,000 square feet, the spa and wellness center is at the heart of the Aman New York—both quite literally, straddling floors nine through eleven, and figuratively, and is perhaps the ultimate expression of this urban oasis. You can swim laps in the magnificent 65-foot pool, or post up on one of the poolside chaises, which are interspersed with fireplaces—yet another fire-and-water pairing. There’s also a hair and nail salon, and a yoga and pilates room is forthcoming. Or, if you’re so inclined, you can commit a half or whole day to one of the two spa houses—one centered around an Eastern European banya, and the other, a Moroccan hammam—where you a few friends can spend the day rotating between massages and treatments, followed by dips in hot and cold outdoor plunge pools on your very own private terrace.', 'Sadly, I didn’t spend the day in either of them—but I did indulge in the New York signature treatment, a two-hour session that included an exfoliating full-body scrub followed by a steam shower and massage.', 'Of course, this being an Aman, the approach to wellness includes a careful integration of Eastern and Western methodologies: You can opt for a quick lift with an IV treatment, or adhere to more traditional forms of treatment, like acupuncture. There are also a number of medical experts on hand, including the Harvard-trained physician Dr. Robert Graham, to assess guests’ needs and create short- or long-term programs for them. Graham’s approach draws from a range of modalities—lifestyle medicine, culinary medicine, botanical medicine, ayurveda, and traditional Chinese medicine—and uses diagnostic testing (like SCANME, which provides a full-body assessment based on 93 parameters, including your cardiovascular, nervous, and respiratory systems) to help devise nutritional and integrative medical plans. For now, the spa is open only to guests, residents, and members, but eventually, massage-starved members of the public will have their chance to get in, too.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Personally, I love Midtown Manhattan—so the hotel didn’t have to convert me to come around to this chaotic, often tourist-heavy neighborhood. To me, it’s one of the most classic, inimitably New York parts of the city, just a few blocks from \nCentral Park\n and Grand Army Plaza, right by Billionaires Row, and on the toniest stretch of Fifth Avenue, with enough top-tier shopping within a one-block radius—Bergdorf Goodman, Chopard, Prada, Gucci, YSL, Burberry—to max out your credit cards many times over (not counting the retail spaces that line the building’s bottom floors, like Bvlgari, Ermenegildo Zegna, and Piaget). Here, you’re at the ultimate crossroads of business and pleasure, with plenty of attractions at your disposal.', 'To me, this area epitomizes so much of the energy that gives Manhattan its special zing, and though there are no shortage of swanky properties in these parts, I found the Aman to be the ideal counterbalance to it. It’s a place you can retreat to after a day of wonderful (if exhausting) overstimulation, leaving everything at the door, and from which you can depart with renewed vigor before each outing.', ""The service\n In keeping with Aman's general ethos, staff are discreet but exacting, gracious but reserved. Formality is the norm here, but not uncomfortably so."", 'Eco effort\n The kitchen is where Aman’s sustainability efforts are most clearly at play: The hotel is committed to sourcing ingredients locally, from the seafood—purchased from the Bronx Fish Market—to its produce, much of which is sourced through partnerships with Grow NYC and City Harvest, which together represent over 750 farmers and manage at least 100 farmer’s markets in and around the city.', 'Accessibility\n There were ample elevators throughout the hotel, which were always available as an alternative to taking the stairs between floors (as in the three-level spa); I also noted a chair lift for the pool, which I haven’t seen in nearly enough other hotels. The hotel is ADA compliant.', 'Anything left to mention?\n Of all the things I could’ve done—in this hotel, or even on the handful of retail-packed blocks surrounding it—I wish I would’ve spent more time gazing out the window from the built-in bench next to my fireplace, or outside on the garden terrace, watching the city go by below. After all, what is New York for, if not to dream?']","730 5th Ave, New York, New York 10019, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/aman-new-york,https://www.aman.com/hotels/aman-new-york

For something lighter there’s Par Ici—a lush, greenhouse-style cafe with a vegetarian focus. Also on the ground-level is a sultry cocktail lounge called Titsou. The Fouquet’s space is already making waves in the neighborhood’s high-end dining scene, and all are sure to be a destination for locals and in-the-know visitors alike. The wisteria-shaded rooftop bar, Le Vaux, offers cocktails and views of the Hudson River for guests and members only.', 'The spa\n Spa Diane Barrière, located on the lower of the hotel’s two cellar levels, is a true respite among downtown’s cobbled streets. The sight of a heated and jet-equipped hydrotherapy pool greets you at check in, and is flanked by relaxation day beds, a sauna, and a steam room. Massages, body scrubs and wraps, facials, and beauty treatments like manicures are available and use Biologique Recherche products. Massage therapists are attentive and detail oriented when it comes to pressure, aromatherapy options, and access to the pool and saunas. The spa is open to non-guest reservations, which can be made online.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Tribeca—the triangle below Canal Street—is a fittingly stylish neighborhood for such a bespoke new lodging option, and it’s easy to see why Barriére and Caspi chose it.

Located in the Johnston building, a limestone-fronted 1908 Beaux-Arts landmark, it draws its character from the architecture of the building.

Spaces here appear to be designed to facilitate socializing—between trendy Transatlantic travelers and natty locals alike. At onsite restaurant Cecconi’s, for instance, we had a particularly amusing conversation around dating etiquette with a local filmmaker at the next table. And earlier that evening on the rooftop, a Rose Sbagliato in hand, it felt completely natural to lean across and compliment the British lady in the Rixo dress—a Ned member in London, here on business.', ""The backstory\n Backed by Soho House parent company Membership Collective Group, the Ned comes to roost in New York having first opened its doors in London in 2017. Occupying what was formerly the location of the NoMad Hotel, The Ned NoMad doesn’t have the grandeur of The Ned London with its nine restaurants, a spa, and two pools, but word has it that a second New York outpost has broken ground within the former American Stock Exchange Building in the Financial District, with a scale to rival its London sibling. The members' experience is at the heart of The Ned NoMad, with most spaces earmarked for members to relax, work, and indulge. (Notably, even though they have the same owners, Ned’s Club membership is separate to Soho House membership.)"", 'The rooms\n The property has 167 guest rooms that range from cozier “crash pads” to larger suites and studio apartments. I stayed in a Medium room which, despite its middling name, at 365 square feet felt large enough for me to spread out. For anyone that has stayed at the shuttered NoMad hotel, the rooms will look familiar, from the rich wood paneling to the Damask dividers—rooms were given a lighter-touch refresh for the opening in June, with a larger refurb planned for the future. My room came with a separate bathroom and walk-in shower, as well as a freestanding clawfoot bathtub that I took complete advantage of. Like all the Soho Houses and The Ned London, the bathrooms exclusively feature products by luxury U.K. brand Cowshed. For extended stays in the city, the property recommends the Studios, which are a more-generous 400 square feet and complete with a king-size bed, writing desk, separate sitting area, and views of the city. For families, adjoining rooms are available. Nightly rates start at $875 per night.', ""Food and drink\n While the rooms haven’t undergone significant transformation, the Ned’s restaurants and bars have been given a new lease of life by the Soho House design team. On the ground floor, secreted behind a curtain, a light-filled atrium comes complete with a stage for musical performances, giant palms, and a two centuries-old French fireplace. Just beyond, a green-hued library that’s a lounge by day and bar by night, as well as Little Ned, a bar and restaurant with 1920s-style booth seating that has retained several design features as well as the popular American classics on its menu from the NoMad days—likely to the relief of longtime patrons. Also on the ground floor are a members-only dining room and Cecconi’s, a popular Soho House franchise that's well-loved for its house-made pastas (try the Maine lobster spaghetti) and wood-fired pizza (the black truffle and the margherita are unwavering favorites). Notably, hotel guests who are not members currently only have access to Cecconi’s and Little Ned, which are also open to the public. A ride up the elevator reveals members-only privileges: The Magic Room, located on the second floor, with its marbled wall coverings and deep-hued upholstery, is inspired by cozy cabaret clubs and primed for smaller performances. Further up, a rooftop bar and terrace with a beautiful cupola, available for private dining and direct views of the Empire State Building, spotlights a cocktail menu created by Chris Moore (formerly of \nDante\n, the legendary circa-1915 West Village cafe) that's also available throughout the hotel.

Sitt, director of Thor Equities Group, who oversaw not only the curation of the works but the renovation of the hotel itself, right down to the selection of coffee beans at Jumpin Jacks, the second-floor coffee bar-cum-cocktail lounge.', 'The hotel also has an incredible amount of outdoor space—some 11,000 square feet—making it feel more like an urban oasis than your standard-issue metropolitan crashpad. It’s an immediate reprieve from the city’s hustle and bustle, where guests can enjoy multiple outdoor seating areas and plenty of actual greenery, plus the rooftop pool, of course, which keeps buzzing late into the night.', 'The backstory\n Formerly The James New York - SoHo, the hotel reopened on May 1 after a nearly year-and-a-half-long renovation as the first-ever hospitality brand from Thor Equities Group.. But it’s Thor’s young and ambitious director, Jack J. Sitt, who gets most of the credit here, overseeing the project at nearly every level and offering input on everything from the toiletries to the staff uniforms, and again, even curating artwork from his own collection to display on its walls. Sitt worked alongside stylist and interior design consultant Melissa Bowers on the property’s design, whose minimalist aesthetic (clean lines, geometric harmony, large windows) nods to the Bauhaus art movement of the beginning of the 20th century.', 'The rooms\n ModernHaus SoHo has 114 rooms spread across 14 floors—10 different room categories, all generous in size. (By Manhattan standards, anyway; Modern Queen rooms start at about 280 square feet.) We stayed in a Horizon suite, which had a spacious sitting room with a royal blue L-shaped couch and mounted television; a bathroom with a walk-in rainfall shower, separate bathtub, and a clutch of Le Labo products; and a bedroom with a king-size bed. For the most part, the suite was nicely appointed, though the minifridge was neither cold nor stocked (the latter as a Covid precaution); and the thermostat in the bathroom never turned on during our stay. But the views—two walls of full floor-to-ceiling windows in both the living room and bedroom, overlooking a vast sweep of SoHo and beyond—more than made up for it. I especially appreciated the switches that allowed the blinds in both rooms to go up and down automatically, as well as the one in the bathroom, which had a glass wall with a curtain that divided it from the bedroom; by lifting the blinds there, you could take a bath or a shower and still have a view, if you wanted to. The bed was also incredibly comfortable, and outfitted with soft Frette linens.', 'The room’s soundproofing was also amazing. We were staying just three floors down from Jimmy, the popular (and well-populated) rooftop lounge, and though we could hear the revelers from our hallway, our suite was pin-drop quiet. Not only is that a rare feat for a place with one of the best-known rooftop scenes in all of Manhattan—it’s a feat for a place that sits above Manhattan, period. We didn’t hear so much as a honk during our entire stay. Had the air conditioning in our room not cut out when we shut the pocket door that separated it from the sitting room, it would have been a home run.', 'Food and drink\n The food at Veranda was arguably the best part of my stay here. The restaurant touts a modern American menu, albeit with global nods to the cuisines of India, Mexico, South America, the Middle East, and Portugal, the ancestral country of Michelin-starred head chef George Mendes (most notably of Aldea). And unlike many of the chefs at his lofty level, Mendes isn’t just splashing his name across the place for street cred; not only is he a partner in the restaurant itself, he’s actually there in Veranda’s kitchen, overseeing it all.', 'And it shows. The service is faultless, with bussers and servers who are attentive without being intrusive; meals are well-paced and sized; and there are excellent cocktails and a wine list that complements most dishes on the menu, plus a sommelier (and a staff mixologist) who can deftly guide you in the right direction. As for the food itself, starters (or in their parlance, snacks) included what might be the best bread “basket” I’ve ever had in New York City—slices of oven-fresh, perfectly chewy sourdough, served with pats of local butter or arbequina olive oil and fat flakes of Portuguese flor de sal— utterly mind-blowing salt cod croquettes, expertly fried and served with a thimble of smoked paprika mayo; and a pizza-like roasted tomato-basil flatbread whose pliable dough and crispy crust had no business being so good in a city renowned for its red sauced specialities. Larger plates delighted equally, as did dessert: chicken rice from the hearth, meant for two people, mixed chicken confit, olive oil-poached breast, smoked chorizo, peas, and kalamata olives, and was followed by a slow parade of mind-bogglingly good traditional (fresh-baked pasteis de nata) and inventive (a citrusy concoction of calamansi lime ganache, pineapple mint marmalade, carrot chai puree, and brown butter shortbread) sweet treats by pastry chef Anthony Roonchareon.', 'The setting itself was relaxed but upscale, with indoor and outdoor seating—plus indoor seating that can become outdoor thanks to a custom-built fully retractable roof. There’s something almost Hamptons-esque about the breezy space, with its indoor-outdoor component, light wood and linens, cushy bench seating, and strings of fairy lights that keep the mood perpetually set. On the far side of the restaurant, away from most of the tables, there’s a large bar and lounge area with stylish seating—ideal for having a cocktail and a nosh before your table’s ready.', 'The spa\n There isn’t a spa, but there are other wellness perks on offer, including a 400-square-foot gym on the 17th floor, equipped with state-of-the-art fitness equipment like a Peloton bike and Technogym elliptical. The hotel also offers rooftop programming five days a week including yoga, pilates, and sculpt classes—and then, of course, there’s the rooftop pool, where you can get in a couple laps if the mood strikes.\xa0\nThe service\n In general, the service was coolly professional, and never overbearing: The hotel (and lobby) is small enough that you’re nearly always acknowledged or greeted by name on your return, which augments the building’s almost condo-like feel, and most of the staff we interacted with were pleasant and welcoming. The only hiccup was that the front desk didn’t always pick up our calls. When the air conditioning in our bedroom automatically switched off for a second time, at around 1 a.m. or so, I had to take the elevator down to the lobby to ask that a handyman be sent up. Ordinarily, in a guest room with regular-size windows, this might have posed less of a problem—but it was warm and sunny outside, which led the room to heat up pretty quickly, even overnight into the early morning.', 'For families\n I didn’t spot any families during our stay, but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t feel accommodated—especially if they booked the Horizon or Penthouse suite, both of which have plenty of room to stretch out. There’s no kids’ club, but there parents and (accompanied) kids can use the rooftop pool during the day, and there’s a decent amount of contained outdoor space where kids of a certain age can roam somewhat freely. But on the whole, the hotel is better suited for couples who’ve made a plan to stay at the hotel at the same time as other couple-friends, albeit in separate rooms, or groups of friends doing the same—a point of convergence, really, with the perfect set of amenities to pass a relaxed weekend in SoHo together that can be easily dialed up by night.', 'Accessibility\n There are elevators that access every level, along with a number of ADA-compliant guest rooms.', 'Anything left to mention?\n This hotel felt remarkably different from any other one I’ve stayed at in New York—and that’s a good thing. There’s more than enough, vibe-wise, to really set it apart. There were some reopening hiccups that still needed to be worked out, but the perks—including a top-notch restaurant, excellent lounge spaces to make up for all the socializing we missed out on during COVID, and 11,000 square feet of private outdoor space, including a party-ready rooftop pool and bar—outweighed them all.']","27 Grand St., New York, New York 10013, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/modernhaus-soho,https://www.modernhaushotel.com/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2019.",2,"At the corner of Ninth Avenue and 13th Street, the Gansevoort Meatpacking  NYC is a short stroll away from the art galleries of Chelsea, the brasserie-style restaurants of the West Village, and the smart boutiques of the Meatpacking District. Highlights include the 45-foot-long, heated rooftop swimming pool with underwater lights; the Duplex Penthouse Suite with a wall of windows looking out towards the Hudson River; on-site restaurant The Chester; and the service, which is remarkable for a boutique hotel. Up on the rooftop, savor classics and shareable dishes crafted with Union Square Greenmarket produce in the lounge, or head to the tucked-away Saishin by Kissaki at the Gansevoort Rooftop for excellent a la carte and omakase sushi with a view of the downtown skyline.","['Why book?\n The Meatpacking District pioneer has reemerged with a new look and grown-up attitude—though it’s still a place that celebrates fun.', 'Set the scene:\n Following a much-needed total renovation, this icon of the Meatpacking neighborhood has a revived style, a world-class art collection, all-new drinking and dining outlets and an upgraded—but always lively—vibe that’s drawing both first-timers and longtime fans. As a result, the crowd is a mix of everyone from brunching neighborhood residents and locals on staycations to international tourists and older couples enjoying the city for the weekend. With such popular attractions as Little Island, the Whitney, the Highline, and designer shopping just blocks away, the hotel is ideal for those who want to get out and explore—but still want to have lots of fun options to come back to.', 'The backstory\n: When this Gansevoort first opened in 2004, it was the heyday of the Meatpacking District’s transformation from a hub of meat packing and processing warehouses to \nSex and the City\n-anointed “It” neighborhood status. As such, the Gansevoort, along with adjacent members-only Soho House, quickly became the epicenter of cool—the preferred hangouts for rooftop pool parties and bottomless Cosmopolitan-fueled brunches. (And the popularity of the hotel soon led to similarly social Gansevoort outposts in places like Miami and Turks & Caicos.) But by 2020, only this Gansevoort remained—and it was looking a little tired. Following a multi-million-dollar renovation unveiled in mid-2021, you’ll now find a casual-cool clientele—including some grown-up regulars from back in the day—lounging alongside pieces by artists such as Banksy, Hassan Hajja, Frank Stella, and Mick Rock.', 'The rooms:\n The 186 guest rooms still have the footprint of the original hotel (that couldn’t be changed), but they were gutted down to the studs and rebuilt with touches like an atmospheric blue and grey ombré wallpaper, backlit walnut headboards, and subway tiled bathrooms. Many suites boast Juliet balconies, while the duplex penthouse was designed by the Italian contemporary furniture brand Poliform (as part of its first U.S. hotel partnership) with a fireplace, full kitchen, and 20-foot-high windows overlooking the Hudson River. Great views abound (book a corner room for the best ones, and double balconies), and all rooms are now equipped with Google Nest Hubs with Google Assistants for accessing hotel services, Mirror home gyms for virtual workout classes, and wireless chargers built into end tables (though, fair warning, these can be a bit finicky.) In the works are a signature fine dining Italian restaurant, and a subterranean bar with bowling lanes, games, and private karaoke rooms.', 'Food and drink:\n On one side of the main entrance sits The Chester, a lively spot for American bites and post-work drinks; on the other side is Coffee + Cocktails (C+C), serving Mediterranean-inspired dishes and a great brunch. Both eateries have indoor and outdoor seating, but C+C’s patio in particular—with its chic, oversized square umbrellas and tables overlooking the cobblestoned street—makes you feel like you are in Europe. Up on the rooftop, savor classics and shareable dishes crafted with Union Square Greenmarket produce in the lounge, or head to the tucked-away Saishin by Kissaki at the Gansevoort Rooftop for excellent a la carte and omakase sushi with a view of the downtown skyline.', 'The spa:\n There’s a mid-sized gym for those who want to get a workout in, and a heated rooftop pool for doing short laps—though it’s really more for dips in between lounging on the surrounding chaises and taking in the 360-degree views.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n The hotel is in the heart of the vibrant Meatpacking District, just blocks from the High Line, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Little Island, and Chelsea Market. There’s tons of \nshopping and dining nearby\n, as well as convenient subway access.', 'The service\n:\n Service is approachable and friendly but very efficient, with quick efforts made to answer questions or deal with any issues. Particularly notable are the bellmen, who make every guest feel warmly welcomed—and who’ll search for a long as it takes to find you a cab.', 'Accessibility\n: Superior category rooms are available in ADA options.

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",3,"Three blocks north of the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue, this polished hotel has spacious rooms starting at 420 square feet—generous for New York. All units have walnut furnishings, wondrously comfortable Duxiana beds, and deep soaking tubs, while the apartment suites each have a full stainless steel kitchen. The hotel is also home to several original paintings by New York City artist Alex Katz—the lobby is a great place to start learning about his work. Tired and don't want to go too far for a good meal? You're in luck; Ai Fiori is downstairs as part of the hotel, serving everything from top-tier pasta dishes to classic Italian negronis made with vintage Campari.","['Why book?\n Generous rooms, apartment-style amenities and understated—but always on-point—service make this such a comfortable stay, some guests practically move in.', 'Set the scene\n Just a couple blocks from the Empire State Building, this luxury hotel straddles the line between the more ornate, old school five-star spots found further uptown and the lifestyle hotels so popular these days. The vibe is definitely understated and sophisticated, but it’s not sedate, thanks to touches like the multi-million-dollar art collection that’s heavy on the colorful work of American artist Alex Katz. There’s also no attitude, so while the crowd spans from heads of state and NBA teams to corporate and family travelers, you’re not going to feel self-conscious if you’re not dressed to the nines or are wandering around in workout clothes. With its residential atmosphere, it feels more like an upscale apartment building than a hotel—albeit one with a Michelin-starred restaurant on site.', 'The backstory\n Originally built as The Setai Fifth Avenue back in 2010, the hotel became part of the Hong Kong-based Langham Hotels and Resorts collection in 2013, joining sister properties in spots from London and Pasadena to Sydney and Shanghai. Renovations have been done along the way, including a year-long re-do completed at the end of 2017.', 'The rooms\n Filled with natural light, the 234 accommodations are some of the most spacious in the city, with even the entry-level Superior rooms coming in at 420 square-feet and featuring large bathrooms and desks. (The average room size is 750 square feet, while the suites are an average of 1000 square feet.) In addition to all the space, many of the rooms have extra features, too; there are three fifth-floor Deluxe rooms that have 650 square-foot furnished terraces, for example, and multiple option with kitchenettes. But what’s helped make the hotel a favorite with long-stay guests (such as those in town for medical treatments) and the entertainment industry crowd (think touring bands, press junkets, and NBA teams playing at nearby Madison Square Garden) are the suites—particularly the 14 one-bedrooms suites, all of which have a washer and dryer, extensive closet space, a kitchen (with a full fridge), an extra half-bathroom and Empire State Building views. Upgrade to one of the three Penthouse or Presidential suites for extra bedrooms, vast living and dining areas, and a custom design by French home décor company Roche Bobois.', 'Food and drink\n Chef Michael White’s Michelin-starred Ai Fiori treats diners to elevated French- and Italian Riviera-influenced cuisine from its perch on the hotel’s second floor; along with the main dining room, there’s an adjacent bar and lounge for small plates, cocktails and a glass of something from the 1,000-bottle-strong wine cellar. In 2021, the restaurant introduced Sky Terrace, an outdoor dining option located on a different floor, and featuring a streamlined menu of shareable dishes. There’s also good (and pretty fast) in-room dining.', 'The spa\n There’s no longer a full-service spa (it was a casualty of the pandemic), but there’s a decent-sized gym with a good selection of Technogym equipment and weights, as well as an area for stretching and doing on-demand classes.', 'The neighborhood/area\n The immediate area around the hotel doesn’t offer much (though you’ll find handy services like banks and delis), but you’ve got Bryant Park and Grand Central Station several blocks to the north, the Empire State Building and the restaurants of Koreatown just to the south, Macy’s and Madison Square Garden further along 34th Street, and Times Square a nice walk away.', 'The service\n As to be expected from the luxury Langham brand, the service is discreet and on-point, but it’s also personable, with staffers happy to chat if you are. It’s easy to see how so many guests—particularly those in who are in for a longer stay—enjoy a nice rapport with the staff members.', 'For families\n There are two categories specifically billed as “family rooms”—both have two beds and one has a kitchenette—but with so many spacious options, those needing extra room really can’t go wrong. The suites with the washer/dryers may be particularly appealing to those traveling with little ones.', 'Accessibility\n There is elevator access to all floors, and multiple ADA rooms are available.']","400 Fifth Ave., New York, New York 10018, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/langham-place-new-york-formerly-the-setai-fifth-avenue,http://newyork.langhamplacehotels.com/

The Wall Street Hotel,,2,"In a part of the city often overlooked by travelers—at least when it comes to choosing a home-base—The Wall Street Hotel is a unique boutique stay in downtown Manhattan whose interiors nod to the area’s history and beaux-arts buildings. The Wall Street Hotel is not only an exciting addition to the landscape, but it also provides a great reason to reconsider Wall Street as your landing pad for a trip to the city. Nearly every train runs through the nearby Fulton center, meaning easy access to just about anywhere in Manhattan (Brooklyn is just a couple stops away, as is Jersey). The neighborhood is jam-packed with history dating back to the 17th century, and a little Googling or a great tour guide can help pull stories out of the landmark buildings in the neighborhood (George Washington hung out at nearby Fraunces Tavern, to give you an idea).","['Why book?', 'In a part of the city often overlooked by travelers—at least when it comes to choosing a home-base—The Wall Street Hotel is a unique boutique stay in downtown \nManhattan\n whose interiors nod to the area’s history and beaux-arts buildings.', 'Set the scene', 'There are few boutique hotels that cater to leisure travelers in the area. For a long time, it’s been mainly business travelers down on Wall Street, and \nThe Beekman, a Thompson Hotel\n, has been the neighborhood go-to for those traveling on their own accord. The lobby crowd seems to provide evidence that The Wall Street Hotel will fall somewhere in the middle of business and pleasure. There are solo travelers with their laptops nearby at the Lounge on Pearl lobby bar, sure, but there are also sharply-dressed couples riding the elevators down to in-building restaurant La Marchande for dinner.', 'The backstory', 'The hotel comes from the Paspaley family, who made their mark in the world of commercial pearling in Australia. That backstory explains the pearl jewelry on display in the lobby, and the mother-of-pearl detail everywhere from guest bathrooms to the entire face of the raw bar in La Marchande. But the connections go deeper than decor: Wall Street is actually part of New York’s historic pearling district (it sits on the corner of Wall Street and Pearl Street, your first clue), and the beaux-arts building that now houses the Wall Street Hotel was acquired by the Paspaleys in a pearling business deal in the 80’s. It’s the first hotel for the group, but judging by the skill with which they’ve pulled it off, it may not be the last.', 'The rooms', 'The 180 guest rooms and suites have decor from Rose Ink Workshop.

That timeless elegance comes to life with brass-and-mirror bar carts in the rooms, rich blue velvets, and large-scale oyster-inspired watercolors hanging over the beds. I stayed in a spacious Carnegie Suite, which included a writing desk and a deep soaking tub with a view over the river, for that perfect mix of work and rest—and because it was a corner room, I got double the vantage points and twice the natural light.', 'Food and drink', 'You’ll want to stop for drinks in the Lounge on Pearl for the decor alone—a playful clash of patterns and colors—though help yourself to an order of oysters and a cocktail while you’re there, and grab a seat near one of the massive velvet-draped windows. The bar emphasizes botanicals (creative gin-and-tonics are their focus), though they tend to be lighter and sweeter. If you’re itching for something stronger—like a martini—you can still take advantage of the fantastic gin selection. As for La Marchande, consider it the spot for an intimate meal you won’t have to go far for—the raw bar options are solid (like the vanilla-cured snapper), and the entrees are delicious (like the king salmon) though portions for mains are modest. I didn’t have a chance to try out the room service, though the menu seems to hit all the right notes for travelers with everything from oysters to burgers.', 'The spa', 'While there isn’t a spa, the Crossfit-inspired gym will resonate with travelers who spend many nights away from home (there’s also a Mirror for DIY workouts, and Pelotons can be made available on request).', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Every New York City tourist knows Wall Street—even those who don’t make a point to see the Charging Bull statue or the \n9/11 Memorial\n know it as the gateway to the \nStatue of Liberty\n and Ellis Island. (And that’s not to mention the many business travelers who have their own reasons for jetting in Monday and leaving by Friday.)', 'But the neighborhood has more to offer than marquee photo ops: It’s jam-packed with history dating back to the 17th century, and a little Googling or a great tour guide can pull stories out of the landmark buildings in the neighborhood (George Washington hung out at \nFraunces Tavern\n, to give you an idea). And the fact that the streets are fairly quiet in the evenings, when most tourists and Wall Street employees leave, only to spring to life come morning? Not a bad deal for a weary traveler who wants a central location without 24/7 hubbub.

Not so much the best of all worlds as its own world.', 'What else should we know?\nThe passage from the car park through the kitchen to the lifts and up to the Kennedy suite—the route that Marilyn Monroe supposedly took to and from her assignations with Mr. President. Also, the Marcel Vertès murals in Café Caryle, some of which were recently touched-up and added to by local artist Glenn Palmer-Smith.', 'Is it worth it—and why?\n Perhaps you could rephrase the question. Are \nyou\n worth it? This is a beguiling mixture of opulence and severity, impossible to locate historically or stylistically.

"The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad","Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"During New York Fashion Week, this already-iconic hotel’s rooftop bar Nubeluz by José Andrés hosted a runway show for Bronx and Banco, complete with a downtown cool vibe and guest list to match—think actress Natasha Lyonne and rapper Coi Leray. Nubeluz (and The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad as a whole) was immediately cemented as an overnight New York City hot spot—just one example of how this legacy brand is reshaping its image. But how did a hotel conglomerate that is thought of as a bit stuffy create a hotel that is familiar to its existing clientele while becoming alluring to a new generation? The answers are found within the lobby which takes its inspiration and pays homage to its location in the floral district, the reservation-impossible Mediterranean restaurant Zaytinya (another José Andrés), view-laden rooms, and skin-tightening subterranean spa. Each space mixes current design trends, like hand-blown Randy Zieber floral petal-inspired chandeliers in the lobby and black Italian-marble walls, with the exceptional, discreet service that Ritz-Carlton is known for. We can’t imagine a more perfect place to shake things up than the capital of reinvention: New York.","['Why book?\n\xa0\nOut of the many, many hotels in \nNew York\n to choose from, the The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad offers one of the most serene (yet cool) escapes in Manhattan. The property is walkable to many of the top tourist attractions, and to local-first neighborhoods, all while adding its own sleek contribution to the NoMad area. The rooms are spacious and the service impeccable, but it’s the design and F&B that makes this property shine with the style-set.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0\nA José Andrés restaurant serving seriously delicious branzino, a handful of hand-blown Randy Zieber light fixtures, and an arboretum’s worth of potted plants all lie behind the large matte-black doors. Spy chic entrepreneurial types sipping old-fashioneds on the green barstools beneath a canopy of shrubbery at the bar. Upstairs, the rooms have cloud-like beds and wide windows with expansive views.', 'The backstory\n\xa0\nAn all-glass, 250-room hotel now cuts into the sky in NoMad, making it one of the most recent additions to the Manhattan neighborhood, opening in July. As part of Marriott’s luxury category, the Ritz-Carlton has a long-standing reputation for its comfortable hotels around the globe, with a focus on service. And while the hotel is certainly comfortable and the service is some of the best I’ve experienced (almost everyone would greet me and my dog by name—from the doorman to the housekeeper), this NoMad location is offering a fresh perspective to the classic brand.', 'The rooms\n\xa0\nMake sure to request a downtown-facing room on floors 25+ for views that compete with the Empire State Building, but instead of fighting tourists for a photo, you can enjoy it from a king-size bed. A subtle gold-hued color palette is employed in the design of the rooms, with contrasts like a bold chain-link chandelier above the bed and floor-to-ceiling, black-and-white terrazzo tiled bathrooms. Each room has a stand-alone soaking tub and steam shower. Rates from $825 per night.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0\nAdjacent to the lobby is Zaytinya, a Mediterranean restaurant by José Andrés. Don’t miss the chilled Ouzo shot with a pickled turnip juice chaser and the whole roasted branzino, so fresh it transported me back to sailing along the Turkish coast when our captain would grill the fish he caught an hour earlier over charcoal. Head to the atmospheric lobby bar for a perfectly shaken Monkey 47 martini, or better yet, upstairs to the rooftop cocktail bar, also by José Andrés, Nubeluz. The bar boasts almost 360 sky-high views of Manhattan in a moody space filled with red velvet booths and gold accents.', 'The spa\n\xa0\nIn the subterranean 6,800 square-foot space, therapists give deep-scrub facials in black Italian-marble treatment rooms. The spa offers everything from custom Augustinus Bader facials to multi-sensory meditation pods, which provide a 15-minute guided experience that is a perfect quick recharge.', ""The neighborhood/area\n\xa0\nNoMad has transformed in the past few years, now competing with the Lower East Side and the West Village for the coolest on the island—and the area feels like a perfect combo of the two. Shops like Maison Ten and Thrifty HoG add to its shopping cred, while some of the city’s most anticipated dining establishments are moving in, like chef Markus Glocker's Koloman, which opened in September. But it’s the hotels that really took the neighborhood to the next level. First Ace moved in making it cool, Nomad (which is now The Ned) soon after pushed it to the next level, and now, Ritz-Carlton has come in and adapted its traditional approach to service to cater to this new demographic, solidifying it as a destination all its own."", 'The service\n\xa0\nThey have taken off the white gloves, so to speak, but they haven’t actually removed them. Like mentioned previously, the staff felt incredibly in touch with the guests of the 50-story hotel, creating a personalized experience that is a feat for the size of the hotel. While still donned in a uniform you’d expect from a Ritz-Carlton, and striving to provide an extremely high hospitality standard, the staff were all extremely generous with their time, smiles, and advice.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0\nThe hotel offers accessible rooms, each with a 32-inch-wide entrance. Anyone in a wheelchair can access everywhere in the hotel from the restaurant to the spa to the lounges.', ""Anything left to mention?\n\xa0\nIf you can get club-level access, do it. The food and views provide a perfect pre (or post) dinner cocktail hour. But it's the outstanding design, spacious rooms, and outstanding views that will make you choose the The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad as your Manhattan home base time and again.""]","25 W 28th St, New York, NY 10001, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/the-ritz-carlton-new-york-nomad,https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/new-york/nomad/

The Hoxton Williamsburg,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",1,"Last fall, when the Hoxton plunked itself down on Williamsburg’s Wythe Avenue—the neighborhood’s unofficial hotel strip—it was as much for New Yorkers as for visitors. Cases in point: a quirky, retro lobby that’s perfect for long, lazy Sunday afternoons; an events space that has hosted, among other things, a pop-up tattoo studio; a rooftop bar that doesn’t have a line (yet). The U.K.-based Ennismore designed the hotel to feel extremely Brooklyn, dotting it with locally sourced vintage furniture and bookshelves displaying hefty tomes on contemporary art, and ’70-style chandeliers hanging from the lofty ceiling. The three on-site restaurants—seasonal Summerly and Backyard and the year-round favorite Klein’s—are overseen by Jud Mongell and Zeb Stewart, the names behind Williamsburg’s beloved Five Leaves, Union Pool, and Hotel Delmano. The cocktails are a delight (order the mezcal-infused Fire Island), and the food spans everything from New American comfort at Klein’s to New England–style lobster rolls at Summerly. Upstairs, the 175 rooms, like the ones at the Hoxton in Paris, are not massive but fit king-size beds and have views of either the Manhattan or Brooklyn skyline.","[""Set the scene for us.\nThe New York outpost of the rapidly expanding Hoxton brand finds itself in the ever-hip north side of Williamsburg, amid a landscape of converted warehouses and factories (rapidly being torn down for fancy residential buildings) in post-industrial Brooklyn, set in a former water-tower factory with a broad statement staircase sashaying down the middle. Walking through the front doors leads you straight into the restaurant and bar, where guests and curious locals tap away on laptops and gossip. Hunting down check-in is a little less obvious; make a hard left and just keep stopping and asking at whatever desk-seeming corner you find (even if it's a coffee bar)."", ""What’s the story behind the hotel?\nThis was the first Hoxton in North America. Born in the\xa0\nLondon\n\xa0district of the same name, outposts already existed in Holborn, as well as\xa0\nAmsterdam\n\xa0and\xa0\nParis\n, when this one opened; since then, Hoxtons have sprouted up in Portland, downtown Los Angeles, Chicago, Rome and more. The Soho House Group was involved in the past, and it’s easy to see the hand of Nick Jones here: those Art Deco touches, subway-style bathroom tiles and velvet headboards. But there’s also local inspiration, such as bespoke linens by Brooklyn-based Dusen Dusen, ceramic pieces, and, in some rooms, books curated by residents (our selection included ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin: The Untold Story of the Wu-Tang Clan's Million-Dollar Secret Album’)."", 'What can we expect from our room?\nThe Manhattan-view rooms are about just that: There are just a couple of low-rise buildings and the East River between you and the Empire State (for now). It’s tempting to stay under the covers of the big bed and stare at the changing colors of skyline all day long. Rooms are compact and clever, with slim brass shelves, hooks, and rails, while the bathroom fits in a brass rainwater shower and deep marble-top sink, with black, honeycomb patterns over the floor. Beds are big and high, so there’s little leftover floor space. Pack your own moisturizer—but everything else is here.', 'How about the food and drink?\nA brand-new restaurant will touch down soon—K’Far, where renowned Philadelphia chef Michael Solomonov serves all-day menus alongside a full bar and a bakery with takeaway goods. And then, there’s the recently opened rooftop bar Laser Wolf, where guests can enjoy elevated Israeli cuisine cooked over live coals, innovative cocktails, and stellar skyline views.', 'Anything to say about the service?\nCheerful and personable. Check-in is quick and easy, and rooms are self-explanatory. There is no concierge service, although reception staff are very happy to give their local brunch picks.', 'Who comes here?\nSimilar to their London counterparts who visited East London after gentrification trickled through, people here have been regular Williamsburgers for some time. Now in their thirties, these days they desire a little more comfort with their Macbook-based creativity and vintage-clothes shopping. New parents bring their babies and own parents for brunch, late twenty-somethings meet for Sunday afternoon cocktails and to work on their dating profiles; digital nomads meet contacts throughout the day for flat whites. There will always be someone wearing a hat.', 'How does it fit into the neighborhood?\nWilliamsburg has been a haven for hipsters for two decades now, and has become the epitome of modern-day gentrification. Former warehouses and factories along Wythe Avenue are now home to Viceland offices, a museum dedicated to pizza, music venue Output, and three relatively new cool hotels: the Wythe, the Williamsburg, and the William Vale. The Hoxton has chosen exactly the right spot to join the party, adding an upscale lounge culture to the table.', ""Anything you'd change?\nMore movies to choose from in the room, for when you really want to zone out from the cool kids downstairs. Also, for the service to have been a little quicker. Sometimes the vibe can get slightly too laid-back."", 'And anything we missed?\nThere’s an additional apartment space available for parties. And, although closed during winter, the roof terrace adds a certain something special to Williamsburg’s list of attractions.', 'Is it worth it—and why?\nThe Hoxton, Williamsburg feels very London—not only has the label transported very smoothly across the Atlantic, it’s also full of Brits, as well as many creative locals. Stay here to feel like you’re among the coolest New York tribe, with reasonable prices and phenomenal views.']","97 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, New York 11249, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/new-york/hoxton-williamsburg,https://thehoxton.com/williamsburg/

Instead, you order online or by dialing “0”, then head downstairs to pick it up.', ""Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThere is no check-in desk (it's all done by phone or tablet), so interaction with staff—for better or worse—is pretty minimal."", 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nNo matter what you do, make time for a drink at the rooftop bar, which has truly incredible 360-degree views of Manhattan (either from floor-to-ceiling windows inside or the expansive terrace outside). Sunset is the ideal time, though after dark, the bar morphs into a nightlife hotspot. There are also plenty of other drinking and dining spots in the hotel, including a lobby bar, a cantina and pisco bar, a Peruvian restaurant and a globally-influenced food market—all overseen by Michelin-starred chef John Fraser and his team.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nFor minimalists, the rooms are just right—clean-lined and totally free of distraction.', 'Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nAt Public, it all comes down to great value—a fair price for super stylish rooms and a massive lobby lounge that doubles as a social gathering place. Plus, the location is hard to beat for fans of this kind of hip, downtown version of Manhattan.']","215 Chrystie St., New York, New York 10002, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/public,https://www.publichotels.com/
The Greenwich,"Gold List, 2020. Gold List, 2024. Readers' Choice Awards, 2018. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021.",3,"In an era of the ever-more-exclusive members’ club luring the black-card-carrying wolf pack, Robert De Niro’s hotel makes privacy feel refreshingly effortless. Built more than a decade ago in a cobblestone quarter of Lower Manhattan, it creates the sensation of stepping into the actor’s own salon. The lobby is hung with abstract paintings by De Niro’s late father, and beyond it more inner sanctums await: A book-filled drawing room merges into a pocket garden, where topiaries cast an Italianate charm. Each of the 88 rooms is idiosyncratically arranged with antique silk rugs, the odd vintage table, and marble bathtubs, while the Tribeca Penthouse is earthy and minimalist. But the enduring revelation is the Shibui Spa, where the lantern-lit pool glimmers under the beams of a 250-year-old Japanese farmhouse. A festive din still kicks up at Locanda Verde, which serves rustic plates of duck orecchiette, and New York fixtures such as Yoko Ono and Jay-Z go pretty much incognito, but things settle down early. The wolf pack can go elsewhere. ","['Why book?', 'With its thoughtful design and hospitality ethos, The Greenwich Hotel can’t help but echo the old Italian American saying: When you’re here, you’re family.', 'Set the scene', 'I checked in on a crisp autumn Wednesday. The lobby was pleasantly sleepy, and I didn’t see much of anyone else, but that’s the hotel’s intended first impression: This 87-room manse is meant to be a getaway for those seeking quiet, a respite from the quotidian bustle of the city beyond its walls.', 'And what stunning walls they are: The exteriors are done in hand-made Pennsylvanian brick, garnished with custom cast bronze medallions—based on historic New York City manhole cover designs—atop the building’s crown. Inside, recycled heart pine flank the corridors like columns holding up the ceilings, themselves beaming with knotty reclaimed wood. All that to say, design is the hotel’s heart, pulsing a refined yet approachable vibe throughout its very posh body. It’s giving understated luxury. It’s giving, “Hi, \nAD\n, welcome to my home.” It’s giving, “Oh, these tiles? I had them made in Italy.” (Literally, the lobby floors were modeled after the terra-cotta flooring in a 14th-century Italian palazzo.)', 'What’s the backstory?', 'This exquisitely designed property in \nTribeca\n opened its doors in April 2008, but feels like it’s been part of the city’s fabric for much longer. Perhaps it’s the hotel’s lived-in aesthetic textures: A principal element of The Greenwich’s myth-making is its commitment to what it calls “Old-World craftsmanship,” evident in the 10-foot ceilings and hand-carved moldings inspired by Parisian parlors, one-of-a-kind Tibetan antique rugs, and leather furniture created by Beaumont & Fletcher in England exclusively for the hotel.', 'Or perhaps it’s the reputation of the ownership: One of the owners is the actor Robert De Niro, who grew up nearby. (Co-owners include the indefatigable hoteliers Ira Drukier and Richard Born of BD Hotels, and De Niro’s son Raphael.) Original paintings by De Niro’s father, the abstract expressionist Robert De Niro Sr., add colorful drama to the hotel’s walls. Childhood photos of both Roberts, found in some guest rooms, are delightful Easter eggs. During my stay, I found a faded picture of Mr. De Niro next to the telephone as I called room service; thus, I experienced a fleeting delusion that I was asking Uncle Bobby’s chef to set up my breakfast for the morning.', 'Describe the rooms', 'Not one of The Greenwich Hotel’s 73 rooms, 11 suites, and 3 penthouses looks like another, all tastefully furnished as if by your chicest, most well-traveled friend. The walnut desks, the Carrera marble, the Morrocan tile, the Savoir beds (so firm-soft that Goldilocks would weep)—it’s all elegant yet easy, thrown together with savvy intention. Standard rooms are large by New York City standards, and smartly arranged for maximum floor space. Suites are gorgeous and ready for move-in; some have views into the sun-filled courtyard, others look out to the cityscape.', 'And the penthouses—oh, the penthouses. I stayed in the North Moore penthouse, a two-bedroom and two-floor residence with two working fireplaces, two bathrooms, a powder room, an office, a fully equipped kitchen (with dishwasher!), a dry sauna, and a steam room. I was pinching myself at the upgrade, but I didn’t get to make good use of all the amenities since I was running in and out during my stay (though I did find time for a steam and a soak in the tub). When I returned late one evening, I found that, during turndown service, housekeeping had drawn the curtains on the 30-foot skylight. I pressed a button on the wall and it took maybe 90 seconds for the automated shades to roll back and reveal to me the splendid skyline of New York at night.', 'How’s the food and drink scene?', 'There are two venues for eating and drinking: the Drawing Room and Locanda Verde. The former is tucked into the core of the ground floor, boasting 12-foot ceilings, cozy jewel-toned sofas, walls lined with bookcases and a wood-burning fireplace, and a bar with an extensive selection of spirits. The bartenders are true pros—they know the IBA cocktail list front to back and take “surprise me” as a challenge. The Drawing Room extends into a calm outdoor courtyard fenced off by French doors and covered by a canopy of latticed vines.', 'Over at Locanda Verde, one of the diamonds in the crown of star chef Andrew Carmellini, the vibe is bourgeois-bohemian: a mix of tourists who have heard good things and New Yorkers gathering for post-work drinks, date nights, and big dinners with friends. The menu is seasonal, but expect staple dishes like lamb pappardelle Bolognese and “My Grandmother’s Ravioli” to be there when you pay a visit. My favorite was the dry-aged duck arrosto, served on a bed of green farro, dressed with fig mostarda, and topped with pistachios—all of it tangy and crunchy, juicy and hearty. Safe to say, by meal’s end, I bought into the marketing copy’s idea of “soul-satisfying” Italian food. The restaurant does breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as 24-hour room service for The Greenwich.', 'Is there a spa?', 'The Shibui Spa takes its cue from Japanese bathing rituals, offering onsen-inspired baths alongside customized facials and massages with hot sake-infused towels. Treatments are extensive and popular with visitors and locals alike, so be sure to book ahead. There’s a lounge area with day beds for those awaiting their appointment or readying for a swim. The pool is perhaps the best indoor dip in the city; though it’s housed in the basement and there are no windows, the soft lighting from the lanterns adds to the moody and serene atmosphere. (I felt embarrassed as I made my noisy laps across the pool, even though I was alone on a weekday morning.) The eclectic design ethos doesn’t stop here either: The whole spa space is framed under the roof of a 250-year old wood and bamboo farmhouse, reconstructed in the hotel by Japanese craftsmen. The gym too is stylishly designed—with hemlock floors and forgiving lights—and the fitness equipment is up-to-date, if unfortunately not sourced from Olympus itself.', 'Talk about the neighborhood', 'Next door over from The Greenwich are the headquarters of the Tribeca Festival, the arts fest formerly known as the Tribeca Film Festival, so that may tell you a bit about the crowd you might see on the street. You can expect sleek executives waiting for dinnertime two-tops at nearby Mr. Chow and Thalassa, as well as Town Cars with heavily tinted windows secreting some star back to their hotel or home (Taylor Swift famously lives in the neighborhood). Tribeca is a monied address, so you’ll likely spot navy suits and pencil skirts commuting to the Financial District in the morning, and blonde moms in cashmere—or their nannies—ferrying children to Little League practice in the afternoon.', 'What’s the service like?', 'At The Greenwich Hotel, service is polished, confident, and friendly—familiar in a welcome way. I was greeted by name whenever I passed through the hotel’s front doors. Once, when I was visibly frazzled and rushing to a drinks appointment, I was offered use of the hotel’s car and driver, complimentary service to anywhere below 14th Street. For what it’s worth, rolling up to a dive bar in a Mercedes-Benz S Class does feel very Tribeca.', 'Accessibility', 'As for specific rooms, there are bookable ADA-compliant accommodations. In the building, there’s a central elevator bank and not a lot of stairs—none to the Drawing Room or Locanda; to the spa, gym, or pool; to any of the rooms. For the duplex penthouses, there are no ramps or elevators inside, but both levels are accessible through the hallways outside.', 'Anything left to mention?', ""In the way that you might adopt by osmosis the aura of a cleverly produced hotel, I really did feel like the most New York-y version of myself during my stay. I felt urbane, settled, and at home in the city in a way I hadn’t in a while—and I've lived here for ten years. Story time: For one of my first visits to the city as a teenager, a family friend offered to host me for the weekend. I didn’t know him that well, but I heard the words “Manhattan apartment” and conjured visions of silk rugs and roaring fireplaces, artwork sourced from far-flung travels and velvet couches into which you could disappear (and be contentedly lost forever). Suffice to say that my grand expectations didn’t meet reality—but they do here at The Greenwich Hotel.""]","377 Greenwich St., New York, New York 10013, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/greenwich-hotel,https://www.thegreenwichhotel.com/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Its distinctive white criss-crossing exterior can be seen from lower Manhattan, but The William Vale, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, also makes an impression when seen up close. Each of the hotel’s 183 guest rooms has balconies, most with views looking over the East River and at the Manhattan skyline. The decor is light, airy, and of-the-moment with hardwood floors, glass-enclosed showers, patterned rugs, and succulents on the nightstand. The hotel also has its own elevated public park and retail shops, as well as a 60-foot rooftop pool, a restaurant from famed chef Andrew Carmellini, and a retrofitted Airstream trailer that serves burgers, fries, and ice cream in the warmer months. As for the hotel name, it’s an homage to William Vail, the original Brooklyn hipster, er, property owner in the 1800s.","['Why book?\n Located in the creative and cultured neighborhood of Williamsburg, this luxury hotel fits the Brooklyn scene perfectly, featuring local art and impeccable views—plus one of the best outdoor hotel pools around.', 'Set the scene\n Unmissable on the Williamsburg skyline, The William Vale adds another offering to the hotly growing neighborhood where you are within walking distance to McCarren Park, Brooklyn’s famous \nSmorgasburg\n, and a number of excellent bars and restaurants. Once inside the hotel, you’ll spy young couples, celebratory groups (think: newlyweds, low key bachelor/bachelorette parties, local friends gathering after work), and the occasional business traveler. The vibe is hip yet relaxed, and you get the sense that the hotel is definitely a fixture of the neighborhood—used by guests and locals alike.', 'The backstory\n A small little piece of trivia: The William Vale derived its name from a 19th-century Brooklynite whose property boundaries encircled the location of the development.', 'The rooms\n There’s no frumpiness here. The room designs are sleek and modern, warmed with a few random pops of color sourced from local Brooklyn artists. All 183 rooms boast floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies, and feature seamlessly integrated technology that even the tech-frazzled (hello, self!) can manage. If you’re really looking for an unbeatable view, the Gotham Corner Suite is your answer. Already spacious for an NYC hotel room, it also features a private, wraparound 380-square-foot balcony, accessible from both the private living room or bedroom. And don’t sleep on the deep soaking tub in the bathroom nestled right up against a huge floor-to-ceiling window. My advice? Wait for the sun to set and draw a bath overlooking the lights of the city. It’s pretty incredible.', ""Food and drink\n There are two main dining destinations on the property, each with its own unique vibe. You’ll find a more relaxed, pre-dinner crowd at their 22nd floor rooftop bar, Westlight. You can sit inside (and it’s certainly beautiful, especially the bar area), but the main attraction is the sweeping balcony offering pretty fabulous views. You have your choice of a full beverage program and a fairly large selection of light bites from the menu. If you’re looking for the sexy, intimately lit dinner spot, you’ll want to hit Leuca, their ground floor neighborhood restaurant from Chef Andrew Carmellini's NoHo Hospitality Group. Offering southern Italian fare, you’re likely to find both hotel guests and non-guests sharing the dinner space. If you see a dish using smoky ricotta on the menu, order it and thank me later. I had their summer seasonal dish of sweet corn agnolotti, smoked ricotta, and roasted cherry tomatoes and I’m still dreaming about it to this day. If you’re a dessert fanatic, though, this may not win any favors in your book as there is a fairly limited offering."", 'The service\n You’ll find a relaxed, casual staff that is friendly and ready to assist with any needs.', 'Accessibility\n The William Vale takes accessibility seriously and offers a full range of ADA rooms. Additional property features include accessible public entrances, accessible registration and concierge desk, Braille signage throughout the property, and much more. You can view their full accessibility statement \nhere\n.', 'Anything left to mention?\n The outdoor pool is an absolute must-mention! Owning the title of the longest outdoor hotel pool in the city, the vibe is elevated yet relaxed. Get some sun at the poolside cabanas, daybeds, or lounge chairs, and when you’re ready for a dip, jump in the pool that’s so long you can even swim laps. And come cooler months, guests can enjoy an ice rink and winter spa concept on the terrace—ensuring al fresco activity all year long. If you find yourself looking for a nosh or two, you’re in luck, as they offer a great food and beverage program served pool-side. Pro-tip: get the coconut shrimp and tomato watermelon salad; both are huge portions and absolutely delicious.']","111 N 12th St., Brooklyn, New York 11249, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/william-vale,http://www.thewilliamvale.com/

You’ll spot well-to-do New Yorkers shuffling into the residences and hotel bar each evening, as well as buttoned-up business people and couples. Nobody is walking through the lobby in their travel-day comfies here.', 'The backstory\n The Hong Kong-based Mandarin Oriental brand operates dozens of high-rise hotels, in cities that typically draw both C-suite execs on business and five-star-seeking leisure travelers: think London, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and, of course, Hong Kong. The New York City property has been around since 2003, and reopened in April 2021 following a COVID closure, with the brand new MO Lounge in the lobby. (By late spring, reservations were already essential for a coveted seat in the cocktail bar.)', 'The rooms\n Even in the most affordable room on offer—the Hudson River View Rooms, which currently start at $745—you’re getting lavish views that few New Yorkers lay claim to. The perspectives—and prices—just go up from there, with rooms categorized by vantage point (Central Park and the Manhattan skyline are also offered), and size, which includes several categories of suites up to the $36,000-per-night Suite 5000. Most guests are staying here for the park-view suites, with the million-dollar (or, starting at $2,295) views.', 'The rooms feel equal parts timeless in their definition of luxury—think heaping, decadent curtains for privacy, heavy black stained wooden desks, and rich hues—and contemporary, with modern artworks hung on the walls, shimmering structural light fixtures, and reflective metal details accenting every room.', 'Food and drink\n Hotel dining is hard in a city like New York, when some of the world’s greatest restaurants lie right outside your door. With the new MO Lounge, the hotel is making the choice not to challenge those with Michelin stars just a taxi ride away, and keeping things rather straightforward—consider the elevated lobby bar the spot for a drink meeting, an order of fries or Pâté en Croûte before that 9:30 dinner reservation, or a comforting bowl of ramen when you’ve had a long day and don’t have the energy to overthink it.', 'The spa\n The Mandarin Oriental’s spa is a major draw—and not only because the wellness center has earned some of the highest accolades in the city. They offer standards like detox wraps and aroma stone massages, plus beauty treatments like hydradermabrasion and sculpting facials.', 'The neighborhood/area\n The Upper West Side neighborhood is well-suited for an elite hotel experience like you’ll find at the Mandarin Oriental. But it’s not just tasting menus at Per Se and and Louis Vuitton storefronts in these parts—you’re also just across the street from Central Park, a brisk walk to Broadway, and well-positioned to hire a black car \nor\n hop on the subway (the nearest stop is a hub for many major lines).', 'The service\n The overall hotel service is attentive in a no-expense-spared type of way. Whatever you want or need, they will make it happen, with care. In return, do the staff the favor of dressing to the smart setting—they seem to genuinely appreciate it.', 'Accessibility\n Elevators connect all the floors, and it’s possible to have a car drop you off right in front of the hotel.', 'Anything left to mention?\n Spring for a Central Park view, and ask for a suite on the southern corner of the building. With the press of a bedside button each morning, the heavy curtains pull back to deliver a jaw-dropping cityscape. By day one, you’ll be inquiring about staying an extra night—or two.']","80 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10023, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/mandarin-oriental-new-york,http://www.mandarinoriental.com/newyork/

Casa Cipriani,"Gold List, 2024.",3,"This New York hotel is a Cipriani property, so it’s luxury to the max, but in that effortlessly chic Italian sort of way. Picture it: presidential suites featuring cashmere-covered walls by Loro Piana Interiors—that’s the sort of luxurious detail you’ll find in every nook and cranny of the guest rooms at Casa Cipriani. The sheets on the bed are from the 150-year-old luxury linen house Rivolta Carmignani based in Macherio, just outside of Milan. Prior to check-in guests can choose between Italian cotton or Italian linen. It’s hard not to fall completely under the spell of the hotel from the minute you step into your room or suite. Maybe it’s the Art Deco light fixtures or artwork on the wall. Maybe it’s the jazz playing softly in the background, or the way the setting sun hit the lacquer furniture and the shiny brass knobs. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the guest rooms at Casa Cipriani are the private terraces. The spacious private terraces. Be sure to request a river-facing room because there’s really nothing like this view anywhere in town: Next to the hotel, you’ve got the Staten Island Ferry pulling in and out of Whitehall Terminal; that’s Governor’s Island straight ahead, and beyond that, Brooklyn. To your right, you’ve got the Statue of Liberty. But there’s also so much going on inside Casa Cipriani that no one would blame you if you spent your entire stay on the premises: the Club restaurant, the Jazz Café, the Pickering Room, the Promenade Bar, and the Living Room. On top of all that, the hotel service is attentive but not at all intrusive. They truly make you feel like you’re the most important person in the room, and who doesn’t want to feel like that for a few nights? From $800. —Lauren DeCarlo","['Why book?\n Because it’s a doubly iconic experience. This is a Cipriani property, so it’s luxury to the max, but in that effortlessly chic Italian sort of way. On top of that, it’s in the landmark Battery Maritime Building, a building so many New Yorkers have seen, but so few have actually ventured into. In some ways, it’s like a portal to a different era in \nNew York City\n, where the action was on the waterfront and where you dressed for dinner. This sounds strange, but after a few hours (or Bellinis) at Casa Cipriani you really could mistake the East River for the canals of \nVenice\n.', 'Set the scene\n Anyone who’s ventured to \nStaten Island\n or \nGovernor’s Island\n by ferry—or driven through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel—has seen the Battery Maritime Building on the edge of the East River. You may not have \nknown\n it was the Battery Maritime Building but you’ve most likely wondered what that Beaux-Arts building was, the massive steel structure that almost perfectly matches the patina of the \nStatue of Liberty\n. It was built in 1909 and served as a terminal for ferries traveling to Brooklyn. Part of it is still used as a ferry terminal today, shuttling visitors to and from Governor’s Island. But the inside of the superstructure has been turned over to Casa Cipriani, a 47-room hotel that’s also a private member’s club. That Aston Martin parked right out front? That’s the house car, and a good indicator of the vibes behind the revolving door. Its proximity to the Downtown Manhattan Helipad—a 30 second ride in the Aston Martin—is fortuitous, since the typical Casa Cipriani guest is likely catching a 15-minute helicopter ride to JFK, or, if flying private, to Newark or Teterboro.', ""The backstory\n Cipriani tapped the living design legend \nThierry Despont\n to oversee the restoration and transformation of the historic ferry terminal. Despont was, after all, the architect and designer hired to take on the $60 million centennial restoration of the Statue of Liberty completed in 1986. He’s also responsible for refreshing iconic hotels like \nThe Carlyle\n in NYC, \nClaridge’s\n in London, \nThe Ritz Paris\n, \nHotel Principe di Savoia in Milan\n. The list goes on. Needless to say, the building and its heritage were in extremely capable hands. Despont wanted guests to feel like they were on a vintage luxury ocean liner. When you walk down the hallway en route to your room or suite, it feels like you're in the corridor of the Queen Mary or the SS Normandie, down to the lacquered hand rail and portholes on the guestroom doors. Inside is all Art Deco—from the lobby to the bars and restaurant to the guest rooms —but the facade hasn’t been altered at all. In fact, the vaulted porch ceiling on the street-facing side of the building still has the original Guastavino tiles; the building was one of his last commissions before he died in 1908."", 'The rooms\n Our one-bedroom suite was lined in Loro Piana cashmere wall coverings. That’s the sort of luxurious detail you’ll find in every nook and cranny of the guest rooms. The sheets on the bed are from the 150-year-old luxury linen house Rivolta Carmignani based in Macherio, just outside of \nMilan\n. Prior to check in guests can choose between Italian cotton or Italian linen. There are two bathrooms—one with a very oversized walk-in shower—and a closet that we’d wager is bigger than most nearby studio apartments. Whoever thought to add the full-length, three-angle mirror deserves a raise because those are a rarity in hotels, and it’s especially useful given the \ndress code\n at Casa Cipriani. It’s hard not to fall completely under the spell of the hotel from the minute you step into your room or suite. Maybe it’s the Art Deco light fixtures or art work on the wall. Maybe it’s the jazz playing softly in the background. Or the way the setting sun hit the lacquer furniture and the shiny brass knobs. Almost instantly I wanted to change my clothes, dab on a little perfume, and slide into a banquette with a stiff drink. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the guest rooms at Casa Cipriani are the private terraces. The \nspacious\n private terraces. Be sure to request a river-facing room because there’s really nothing like this view anywhere in town: Just beneath you, you’ve got the Staten Island Ferry pulling in and out of Whitehall Terminal; that’s Governor’s Island straight ahead, and beyond that Brooklyn. To your right, you’ve got the Statue of Liberty. Standing out there, as water taxis zip past and passengers trudge onto the ferry en masse, it’s abundantly clear that the ocean liner vibe Despont was creating, extends out here as well, to the water’s edge. It’s the perfect spot to have your morning coffee and one last night cap before turning in.', 'Food and drink\n This is probably a controversial take, given that Casa Cipriani is located in one of the greatest cities in the world, but, you really don’t ever have to leave the property. There’s so much going on inside Casa Cipriani that no one would blame you if you spent your entire stay on the premises. Guest rooms are on the third and fourth floors, but the fifth floor is the soul of the place. It’s where you’ll find the Club restaurant, the Jazz Cafe, the Club Bar, the Promenade Bar, and the Living Room. Remember it’s a private club, so during the day, guests and members commingle in the elegant yet cozy Living Room, laptops open, cappuccinos flowing. The Art Deco features—the sconces, the sleek sofas, the credenzas, the tiled fireplace—all make a truly impressive backdrop for some exquisite people watching. The Living Room also extends outdoors to the rooftop Terrazzo Bar with views that are almost too distracting. One Friday, I was in the Living Room when, at the stroke of 4pm, martini glasses swiftly replaced espresso cups as Golden Hour descended upon us. The transition from day to night was palpable. It was as if the entire room gently exhaled and settled in for Act Two of this extraordinary experience. The Living Room takes up the south side of the building. The Club, on the north side, is where you’ll want to have dinner. It does all the Cipriani classics—carpaccio, baked tagliolini with ham, baby artichokes—and a has a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Again, it extends outdoors onto a massive terrace overlooking the East River. Book a table when you book your stay—reservations tend to fill up and you wouldn’t want to miss it. If you’ve been to the original \nHarry’s Bar\n in Venice, you’ll feel right at home at the Club Bar. Between the Living Room and the Club is the Jazz Cafe and the river-facing Promenade Bar—pull up a stool, order a Sidecar and listen to some Chet Baker before heading into The Jazz Cafe (open Tuesday to Saturday evenings from 7pm-1:30am). The latter is meant to feel like a 1930’s supper club. When we slinked out just after last call the band—and the crowd—was still going strong.', 'The spa\n The treatments run the gamut from body scrubs and acupuncture to IV infusions and cryotherapy. I’m still thinking about my HydraFacial MD. It was hands down one of the greatest facials I’ve ever had partly because my aesthetician was one of the most knowledgeable I’ve encountered. It’s not an exaggeration to say I think of this woman most nights when I’m applying my serum before bedtime.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Casa Cipriani, at the very Southern tip of Manhattan, is perfectly situated in many ways. It’s at the foot of the FDR Drive which means you can get uptown in a flash. If you’re headed to the west side, you can easily loop onto the West Side Highway. You’ve got quick access to Brooklyn, subways, ferries, and Lower Manhattan which has more going on than ever before.', 'The service\n The first time I heard from Michael, our concierge, it was a few days prior to our stay. He asked if we needed the house car—the Aston Martin—on the day we were due to check in. The car was ours whenever we needed it. He went on to say that he wanted to ensure our room was prepared to our liking: would we prefer still or sparkling water? Linen or cotton sheets? Fresh fruit, chocolate, or maybe assorted cheeses instead? The service is considered but not at all intrusive. They truly make you feel like you’re the most important person in the room, and who doesn’t want to feel like that for a few nights?', 'Accessibility\n In five rooms and suites, all the doorways are wheelchair accessible. The hotel does a good job of making it clear which rooms and suites these are: On their website, there’s an “accessible” filter under the Rooms & Suites menu. There are ADA compliant door pulls, bathtubs, and knee clearance and counter height provided at vanities. Grab bars are provided at the toilet and bathtub, and the peephole has a minimum of 180-degree range of view. There’s elevator access throughout the building.']","10 South Street, New York, NY 10004, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/casa-cipriani,https://www.cipriani.com/us/casa-cipriani

Freehand New York,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022.",1,"It’s a given that young visitors to New York don’t want to blow the budget on a fancy hotel room. Better to book something that’s at least clean, comfortable, and strategically located, and spend the extra cash on that restaurant everyone has been posting about. Freehand takes this compromise and somehow manages to make it feel sexy and stylish. Rooms, including queens, kings, and bunk rooms for four, are basic—verging on dorm-like—but brightened up with artworks that sometimes snake across the walls and ceilings. Like the model that Ian Schrager engineered with Morgans Hotel in the 1980s, here it’s all about the public spaces, which the design studio Roman and Williams filled with glossy tiles, dark woods, and walls in deep turquoise, with quirky touches such as sheepskin rugs and plants in mismatched ceramic pots. Most importantly, there’s a feast of food and drink options: an outpost of award-grabbing cocktail joint Broken Shaker on the roof; a to-go counter off the lobby, an offshoot of downtown favorite breakfast spot the Smile; and two restaurants and another bar from Gabriel Stulman, of the West Village’s Bar Sardine. Freehand captures everything travelers come to New York for, under one well-designed, well-priced roof.","['Set the scene for us.\nThis is a hotel that does young, hip, and affordable extremely well—something so many places often fail at spectacularly. Open spaces, including the restaurants and the mezzanine lounge, are filled with music, color, art, plants, and people enjoying craft cocktails that they’ve waited half an hour for.', ""What’s the story behind the hotel?\nIt's the one of four Freehand hotels (there's also \nMiami\n, \nLos Angeles\n, and \nChicago\n) from the same team behind the \nNoMad\n. It’s set in a building that dates to 1928 and was thoughtfully renovated by Roman & Williams, the supercool design duo who started out as Hollywood art directors, and who are known for their friendly, sometimes theatrical, and often quite idiosyncratic interiors (they worked on various private houses, including one for Gwyneth Paltrow, and the new British Galleries at The Metropolitan Museum of Art)."", ""What can we expect from our room?\nVarious sizes—but one of the main draws if you're traveling with a group are the bunk rooms, which sleep four. The rooms are comfortable, and relatively spacious for Manhattan, though a little bit dorm-y with simple wooden beds and low sofas. Ten artists from Bard College were invited to paint or draw original work directly onto the walls and ceilings. Bathrooms are small but neat with good lighting, slick green tiles, and blonde wood."", ""How about the food and drink?\nPlenty to choose from. There's an outpost of award-grabbing cocktail outfit \nThe Broken Shaker\n (first a pop-up at the Freehand Miami, then with permanent bars in \nChicago\n and \nL.A.\n) on the terrazzo-covered roof—guests get to skip the line that often forms down the block at weekends. Just off the lobby, you can pick up kale and carrot sandwiches and sea-salt chocolate-chip cookies from The Smile To Go. On the mezzanine, there's the wood-paneled bar and the North African-influenced Studio. Downstairs is Simon and the Whale, a sleek New American spot for clam chowder and pulled-chicken spaghetti. Downstairs is Comodo, a Latin American-inspired eatery serving vibrant, bold flavors, with options like picanha (sirloin cap) with creamed spinach and farofa or wild mushroom tacos with Oaxaca cheese and habanero ash. And above the mezzanine level, gather at the brand-new Georgia Room, a sophisticated space paying homage to artist Georgia O’Keeffe while ushering in eclectic energy from the neighborhood (and throwing some seriously good parties). And then there’s Bar Calico, a lounge equally inspired by the landscapes of New Mexico and New York (while honoring the building’s original 1930s architecture). Come here for modern takes on the classics, including the Martini Caprese (with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and tomato and basil-infused vodka)."", ""Anything to say about the service?\nChipper and to-the-point, but you can sense when they're overwhelmed by the occasional crowds."", 'Who comes here?\n Well-traveled and young, out for a good time, and willing to spend more on a meal than they are on their hotel room. For Levi-wearing local creatives, it’s becoming a hop-in-hop-out rendezvous before a night out.', ""What’s the neighborhood scene?\nThis is strategically located more than anything else. The Flatiron district is low-key and just far away enough from the madness of Midtown or the cool-hunting fray of Downtown. The immediate surroundings aren't exactly hopping, but you're a quick 6-train ride from other places."", ""Anything you'd change?\nThe color palette in the rooms is a little bit forgettable, but then again you're not going to be spending that much time in them. It's all about the public spaces here."", ""And anything we missed?\nInstead of in-room minibars there's a shop in the lobby with snacks and drinks (and chic candles, and throw blankets, and designer toothbrushes)."", 'Is it worth it—and why?\nYes. For genuine style and great vibes at a non-panic-inducing price for Manhattan, this hits the spot.']","23 Lexington Ave, New York, New York 10010, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/freehand-new-york,https://freehandhotels.com/new-york/

The building also houses 157 private apartments, and that hushed residential atmosphere can be felt on the 24 hotel floors, as well, resulting in luxury that is more polished and sedate than gilded or ornate.

The main wellness floor houses a 75-foot heated lap pool, a well-stocked fitness center (with Peloton bikes), a steam room and infrared sauna, and a sundeck; these are open to hotel guests, people who book spa services, and members of Club27, an intimate, membership-only space launched in late-2020 to offer a more personalized approach to fitness and wellness. In the spa, services range from on-target massages, pampering body rituals and effective facials using premium skin care products to meditation, crystal healing, stretching and mindfulness. One-on-one sessions in yoga, boxing, personal training and more are available, and the hotel also partners with outside experts—including the Princeton Longevity Center—for special wellness experiences.', 'The neighborhood/area\n In the immediate vicinity, you’ve got Battery Park City, the Financial District, retails hubs like Brookfield Place and sites like the National September 11 Memorial & Museum; Tribeca, Chinatown, the Seaport, the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan’s main judicial district are all an easy walk away.

It has been immortalized in songs, films, and books (see “Third Week in the Chelsea,” by Jefferson Airplane, and Patti Smith’s \nJust Kids\n, for starters).

The Chelsea finally reopened this year, from the team behind \nThe Ludlow\n and \nThe Bowery\n—with some overdue upgrades.

For both guests and locals to the area, it's a great spot to meet a friend for a drink, without the sterile gloss you sometimes get at a hotel bar. That said, El Quijote, known for Spanish classics, remains the gem of Hotel Chelsea with its famous paella, vermouth-rich cocktails, and ever-present cool crowd (book a reservation ahead of time).\xa0\nThe neighborhood/area\n This part of Chelsea has a gritty exterior.

Its design aims to bring a West Coast vibe to Midtown Manhattan with 30 sprawling suites, modern furnishings, abundant greenery, and warm recessed lighting in both the rooms and common areas.

The eye-catching structure is made up of rippling waves of floor-to-ceiling glass windows, giving the front-facing rooms semi-circle window nooks from which to take in the panoramic city views.', ""The rooms\n Every room features floor-to-ceiling windows, and a collection of 30 suites means there is no shortage of room types, from city kings and doubles to skyline corner studio suites and one-bedroom suites. Those options culminate with the Pendry suite, a 21st-floor, two-bedroom corner suite with a baby grand piano. There are standalone bath tubs by the windows in every suite (showers and wash closets are separate), plus another half bathroom, walk-in closet, and roomy living area that make the upgrade well worthwhile. Nightly turndown with soft slippers and bedside macarons includes a uniquely New York touch: you'll return to gentle Billy Joel and Paul Simon music softly filling both the living area and bedroom wing. Each and every room has been engineered to block out street noise, a facet any easily disturbed sleeper will greatly appreciate in traffic-addled Midtown. (I didn't stir once during my stay despite being a light sleeper who often struggles to sleep in NYC.)"", ""Food and drink\n Two main dining options include Zou Zou's for colorful Eastern Mediterranean cuisine and the fourth-floor Vista Lounge for daily breakfast and the in-room dining menu. Bonus food and beverage options include Black Fox Coffee Shop at street level, and the speakeasy-esque Bar Pendry, a warmly lit space tucked away off of the breezy ground-floor Garden Room. Bar Pendry draws in locals for drinks (try the bee-pollen mango sour, a classic Manhattan, or dip into the well-curated international wine list) and elevated bar food like steak frites and seasonal salads, all enjoyed on a cushy couch or a bar stool beneath an abstract gold leaf Nancy Lorenz mural. The reservation-only rooftop whiskey bar (dubbed The Rooftop) is an added bonus."", ""The spa\n There's no spa on site, but a 1,700-square-foot fitness center and the option of having an in-room Peloton set up (the virtual exercise company's Hudson Yards headquarters is visible from the hotel gym itself) will be much appreciated by fitness gurus."", 'The neighborhood/area\n The eight-acre, mixed-use area of Manhattan West boasts shiny new shopping venues, a variety theater, a Whole Foods Market, and restaurants by the likes of \nDanny Meyer\n and Iron Chef \nMasaharu Morimoto\n; steps away is Penn Station, making it a go-to for business stays or as a home base close to Broadway shows.', 'The service\n Attentive and cheerful; none of your exits or entrances via the cozy lobby will go without a greeting.

Nine Orchard,"Hot List, 2023.",3,"Ask any in-the-know New Yorker for their favorite neighborhood, and chances are the Lower East Side will be it. The place teems with urban cool. Tattoo parlors on every corner. Low-key restaurants where the plates rival those in SoHo, but the crowd is a blend of skaters, designers, and musicians. When Nine Orchard opened June 2022 on a historic corner in the neighborhood, it brought with it a degree of sophistication seldom celebrated here. There are the historical bones, for one, located inside an old, grand bank, with an airy lobby bar humming under old vaulted ceilings that rival those up at Grand Central. A superstar food pairing in the way of Ignacio Mattos, one of the city’s hottest chefs, means classic dishes like steak au poivre and frites are exceptional at the attached Corner Bar (the tables are lovely with their minimal settings but the pick of seats is one of the 40 stools at the wraparound bar). With a full belly, you’ll happily plunk down into one of the property’s 113 guest rooms with simple wood bed tables and hand-carved chairs that feel like a groovy space to tune into the custom radio stations created for the hotel by DJ Stretch Armstrong and Devon Turnbull, New York-based DJ and producer who focus on New York inspired music on all four of the in-hotel stations. Whatever station you choose, this landmark hotel offers locals and visitors alike a sense of being grounded in a place, and pays homage to the neighborhood and its city as one of the very best in the world. Rooms from $525. —Lara Kramer","['Why book?\nLocated in one of \nNYC\n’s most energy-packed neighborhoods, Nine Orchard is the newest addition to the Lower East Side, offering impeccable design, VIP city views, an impressive cocktail scene plus food from superstar \nIgnacio Mattos\n.', 'Set the scene\nOriginally built in 1912, Nine Orchard is a bank-turned-hotel complete with details that would make an architecture lover woozy. The team took painstaking efforts to restore the historic bones, with the main star being the original vaulted bank ceiling of the hotel’s cocktail lounge. Rivaling \nGrand Central Terminal\n’s impressive ceilings, it’s impossible not to be distracted by what you can see above while sipping your expert martini surrounded by stylish guests and neighborhood creatives.', 'The rooms\nBefore you ever walk into one of the 113 guest rooms, you’ll notice all of them are labeled as an homage to NYC apartment living–2A, 4F. It helps live up to the task of a home away from home which the hotel goes for, but in this case, it’s more like your own home in this big city. It’s a nice fantasy here, too. Minimalist, chic design touches are everywhere, from the quality craftsmanship of the custom bed frames to the restored wall moldings, along with the dreamiest of mini bars stocked with luxury treats like \nTony’s Chocolonely\n bars and bourbon whiskey from \nKings County Distillery\n made one borough over in Brooklyn. Every room has a custom speaker system, programmed with New York-inspired radio stations created for the hotel by DJ Stretch Armstrong and Devon Turnbull. Room tip: If you’re looking for wrap-around views of the city (including peeks of the Chrysler Building and the \nEmpire State Building\n), ample space, and a walk-in shower that dwarfs you, stay in 5K. Featuring a cozy king-sized bed and a generous sitting area, this corner room is a perfect slice of Nine Orchard. Rates from $475 per night.', 'Food and drink\nThe food and beverage program is worthy of a visit even if you’re not staying at the property as a guest. Led by the talented Ignacio Mattos, of Mattos Hospitality, you’ll find two currently open dining spaces, with a third to come. For your first stop, hit the Swan Room (the lobby lounge) and don’t be embarrassed if you gasp as soon as you walk in; I certainly did. The old restored bank ceilings, rich velvet booths snaking through the center of the room, bar staff in white jackets mixing magical concoctions for guests’ delight—it all draws you into a world with competing elements of old timey flair and modern visual treats. There are a few light snack options on the menu, but don’t come here planning to eat: You’re here for the cocktails. And boy are there \na lot\n of cocktails. Featuring over 20 different options, the menu offers everything from digestifs to martini service. If you’re looking for a cocktail recommendation, treat yourself to The Jardin, an expert mix of gin, cantaloupe, dill, aquavit, and lime. One important note: Be sure to make a reservation in advance to enjoy the lobby Swan Room. (The space isn’t large, but the wait list for those without a reservation definitely was.)', ""After you’ve wet your whistle, head across the lobby to the Corner Bar where Mattos brings bistro classics like steak au poivre and pomme frites served in a cozy room centered around an impressive 40-seat bar. All orders featured generous portion sizes—vegetarians be warned, meat and fish feature heavily throughout the menu. That said, a special shoutout goes to the spaghetti pomodoro, described by my waiter as tasting like it's from your favorite nonna’s kitchen, and one of the highlights of the meal. If you’re one who can’t leave without a sweet bite, don’t skip the crème brûlée. Served in a dish as large as your head, the rich decadence is the perfect finish to the evening."", 'The neighborhood\nLocated on the corner of Orchard and Canal Street, the playground of the Lower East Side is at your fingertips. You can walk to a gluttonous selection of restaurants and bars, \nChinatown\n and Little Italy attractions, and a personal favorite, the \nTenement Museum\n. You also have your choice of subway access if you’re looking to explore additional NYC neighborhoods, with the A, C, and F trains a one-minute walk from the hotel.', 'The service\nIt’s relaxed and attentive. This isn’t the corner of the city for stiff white-gloved formality. The staff tended to be young and street stylish, with the front desk team being particularly warm and welcoming. I also had the pleasure of meeting Matt Moore, the General Manager, who was a fixture of the property during my stay and was armed with excellent neighborhood recommendations.', 'For families\nWhile the friendly staff and spacious rooms are certainly hospitable to families, the overall vibe takes its cues from the neighborhood–chic, cool, and largely for adults.', 'Anything left to mention?\nA desirable city location can oftentimes come with undesirable city noises. If you’re a light sleeper, you may want to pack a pair of \nearplugs\n or bring your favorite white noise device. Personally, as a self-proclaimed poor sleeper, the street noise truly wasn’t bad, but I could see peak summer weekends potentially causing some sleepless nights for the unprepared.']","9 Orchard St, New York, New York 10002",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/new-york/nine-orchard,https://nineorchard.com/
Ace Hotel Brooklyn,"Hot List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"The lobby in any Ace hotel is the place to be, and its Brooklyn outpost is no different. There are public workspaces galore—including a library-style table, a plant-filled garden, and a moody bar area with cozy seating—and plenty of guests, locals, and staff making use of them all. Many of the hallmarks of Ace decor are present in the 287 rooms: plywood furniture that offers both form and function, local art, and pops of color (in this case, a deep green). But the room design also leans into the industrial building’s architecture, with exposed concrete and warehouse windows.","['Why book?\n The Ace is bringing its tried-and-true mix of lobby culture and impeccable design to the fringe of Brooklyn’s bustling downtown.', 'Set the scene\n The lobby in any Ace hotel is the place to be, and its Brooklyn outpost is no different. There are public workspaces galore—including an extra-long, library-style table; a plant-filled garden with a full ceiling of skylights; and a moody bar area with cozy seating—and plenty of guests, locals, and Ace staff making use of them all. The Wi-Fi is free, outlets are plentiful, lobby happy hour kicks off at 5 p.m. and options for meeting up with friends or colleagues—or even taking a quiet Zoom call—are endless. (Plus, the hotel is dog-friendly, so when I sat down to get work done, it was next to two very well-behaved Cavalier King Charles Spaniels named Darcy and Bingley.) It’s all part of Ace’s mission to involve the neighborhood in the hotel’s success, as much as the guests. Here, that actually starts outside, on the aptly named “Stoop,” with two concrete picnic tables in front of the entrance to invite passersby to take a beat and relax.', 'The backstory\n Ace Hotel is known for opening in neighborhoods on the rise, ever since its first hotel opened in a former Salvation Army halfway house in \nSeattle\n. The one exception may be its Manhattan outpost, just south of the Empire State Building. So, for its second \nNew York\n hotel, Ace chose to skip \nWilliamsburg\n and head to South Brooklyn, parking itself in a no-man’s-land between the borough’s downtown area and leafy Boerum Hill neighborhood. Is it New York’s shiniest or cleanest area? No—but it’s smack in the bustle of Brooklyn, across from a Goodwill and a few residential high-rises and within walking distance of Barclay’s Center, with access to some of the city’s most connected subway lines and buses. And that’s exactly in line with the Ace spirit.', 'The rooms\n With 287 rooms, the Ace Hotel Brooklyn is the brand’s largest opening yet and the third under the creative direction of Roman and Williams. Many of the hallmarks of Ace decor are here: plywood furniture that offers both form and function, local art, and pops of color (in this case, a deep green). But the room design also leans into the industrial building’s architecture, with exposed concrete and warehouse windows. For guests on the north side, those windows offer a \nRear Window\n-style view into the neighboring high rise—and I can only imagine vice-versa, so consider asking for a west-facing room if the view, or privacy, is a priority. At just about 300 square-feet, the queen and king rooms from $249 are well appointed for New York, with desks, petite sofas, Smeg mini-fridges, and spacious bathrooms with Rudy’s Barbershop amenities. Larger rooms and suites feature similar interiors, but with turntables and records curated by Rough Trade.', 'Food and drink\n Chain restaurants rule in downtown Brooklyn, and those to the south are the type of locals-only spots that you aren’t likely to find on any best restaurants list, setting the Ace’s restaurant apart from the rest. As You Are serves up a “menu inspired by the multitude of culinary traditions brought to Brooklyn from around the world:” Think lamb ribs, latkes, whole roasted ducks, and baked clams. While the mains are delicious, it’s the apps and the desserts that drew me in—crispy Brussels sprouts with a tangy sauce gribiche and the strawberry-watermelon sorbet were return-worthy. But dinner isn’t the only meal served up in this ground-floor space. I stayed just days before the restaurant’s coffee and pastry bar was set to open. Led by pastry aficionado Danny Alvarez, formerly of Manhattan’s beloved Daily Provisions bakery, it offers goodies like bean, egg, chorizo, and focaccia breakfast sandwiches, Portuguese pastéis de nata, and coffee from local micro-roastery Sey between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m.', 'The neighborhood/area\n In an area filled with Hampton Inns, this is a delightful addition. But, it’s the kind of place you stay on your second, third, or 20th time in New York. It’s best for travelers who prefer the subway, are prepared for the streets to always be busy, and know that the city’s best restaurants, shops, and bars are found by wandering around new neighborhoods aimlessly. It should only be a first timer’s pick if you’re here just for a show at Barclay’s or are visiting people who live in the area.', 'The service\n Service here is casual but helpful—the front desk sits within a gift shop stocked with Ace merch and local artisans’ work. Pop by for anything you need (extra toothbrush, directions, etc.).', 'Accessibility\n There are no stairs on the entire ground level which comprises the lobby, lobby bar, workspaces, restaurant, and Stoop. Elevators connect you to the rest of the hotel, which features explicitly accessible rooms.', 'Anything left to mention?\n It’s not often I feel the need to mention a hotel gym—but this gym is stellar, and not just because of its functional equipment. The Ace team partnered with Yeah, I Work Out, a streetwear-meets-gym apparel brand, to design the third-floor gym, filling it with vintage equipment, ‘80s wrestling trophies, and bodybuilder posters. It feels opposite to the usual boxy, white, stark hotel gyms I’m used to—in the best possible way. It’s not particularly big, but it’s filled with more than enough character to get you through your workout.']","252 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, New York 11217, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/brooklyn/ace-hotel-brooklyn-review,https://www.acehotel.com/brooklyn/

Gutstadt, who previously led fitness brand Equinox's hotel strategy, has clearly taken some of his alma mater's fitness fanaticism to heart in creating Fitler Club; see Field House, Fitler's 25,000-square-foot exercise area, and one of its most impressive selling points. He clearly understands what high-paying members expect from their amenities, and he's made sure that Fitler Club delivers: few to no wait times for machines, plenty of staff support in the form of trainers and instructors, F&B led by hometown Philly \xa0boy Marc Vetri, an absolutely smashing cocktail program. The membership selection process is opaque at best, but the general idea is to bring the area's movers and shakers together under one well-designed roof: athletes, doctors, investors, and the like. Fortunately, Fitler's 14 hotel rooms are open to the public, so you won't be subjected to that—it just means you might be doing Pilates next to someone who can advance your career."", ""Tell us about your digs.\nI was in room six, about midway down a hallway, which was perfect. (I'm pretty noise-sensitive, and I hate being near doorways or elevators.) The room was sleek, a sort of high-end take on a locker room, which felt in keeping with the property's emphasis on fitness: locker-like doors on the nightstands and cabinets, and a graphic, black-and-white graph-print comforter. The modular couch looked cool, though it was pretty uncomfortable, and didn't have any designated reading light—but the bed and comforter were among the most (if not \nthe\n most) comfortable I've ever slept in. The bathroom products smelled divine, and I loved the rainfall shower. (And, if it were somehow possible, I would've loved to have stolen the pale marble sink, which dipped in just a little, for my own home.) The HVAC was also incredibly receptive and strong, which I appreciate as someone who likes to sleep in a chillier room—and which I often find lacking in hotels. The hotel receives an honorable nod for the excellent espresso/cappuccino/americano maker that sits in the hallway outside the guest rooms; there's really nothing better than gratis coffee that doesn't taste like nutty dirt."", ""How was the service?\nI found the staff to be totally charming, if a little out of their depth, particularly when it came to the hotel component. It's understandable, given that the majority of their time and energy is spent catering to Fitler's 2,700 members, who likely have a very different set of requests than hotel guests. To wit: the bag debacle. On schlepping my stuff into the hotel, no one at either of the reception desks (I saw two) offered to take them, or help me carry them, which you'd absolutely expect at a hotel at this price point; and on check-out, I somehow wasn't offered a copy of my bill. Instead, I got into the elevator, had that realization, then went back and asked for it. Small things like that—a few key elements of the anticipatory, rather than reactive service you'd receive from a high-caliber establishment are, notably, still missing."", 'What\'s the scoop on the F&B?\nInitially, chef Kevin Sbraga had signed up to lead Fitler Club\'s F&B, though prior to its opening, the responsibility shifted to chef Marc Vetri, whose \neponymous restaurant\n regularly turns up on Philly\'s ""Best of"" lists. I\'m agnostic about this change—but I will say that Vetri has worked up a mean brunch and lunch menu (there\'s dinner, too, though I didn\'t stay at Fitler long enough to test it out.) I ate brunch in the dining room on the one day that I woke up at the hotel, and treated myself to an excellent lobster burrata omelet—the lobster was succulent and sweet, and the burrata creamy (if a little watery)—and an avocado toast. The latter didn\'t quite impress me—the avocado smear tasted a little pre-packaged—but the thick, multigrain toast it sat on was crunchy and complex in flavor. There was also a little pastry and Bloody Mary bar at the back; I treated myself to a few bites from the former, and can happily report that the cinnamon-raisin bun checks out. I\'d come here for a relaxed brunch, certainly, or for a pre-dinner drink; my Green Hornet, a subtle tequila-and-egg-white concoction, from the night prior, was perfectly balanced.', ""What are the other guests like?\nI couldn't really tell the other hotel guests apart from club members—it's not like they went around wearing pins. But as far as Fitler members go, think male and female variations on Kevin Plank: fit, rich, authoritative, determined, interested in exercise and making deals."", ""What's the surrounding neighborhood like?\nAt first, I was skeptical of Fitler's location, right by the Market Street bridge. Okay, yes, sure: It's convenient if you're going to and from the train station, but that's certainly not the case if you're interested in seeing—or experiencing—the cobblestoned charm of Society Hill. Fortunately, it's really only about a 10-minute walk from Rittenhouse Square. (Bonus points: behind it, across the street, sits the \nMütter Museum\n. You can walk to most things in Center City in about 20 minutes; and because of its prime location along Market Street, a main drag, Ubers are nearby and numerous."", ""Other features you liked?\nThere's a cushy screening room in the club, which is great for watching Eagles games with fellow Philly fanatics. There's also a two-lane bowling alley, equipped with its own bar, which I wish I'd had the insight to check out on the night I stayed over. Oh, and shout-out to my talented masseuse, Jenny, who gave me a terrifically relaxing 50-minute massage (and whose very presence felt calming)."", ""What changes would you make, if any?\nAs I mentioned, I'd station a doorman near the back entrance to let guests in, and help them with bags. I'd also put a thicker door or divider between the pool area, where kids are running around and making noise (as kids are wont to do) from the spa. I had something of a tough time relaxing, despite my wonderful masseuse, because I could hear kids shrieking nearby.""]","24 South 24th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/philadelphia/the-rooms-at-fitler-club,https://fitlerclub.com/
Roost East Market,,1,"Housed on five floors of an upscale residential building in the city’s centrally-located Midtown Village neighborhood, the spacious, meticulously-designed luxury apartments here are meant for extended stays, from a week to several months. With sunlit rooms, high-kitchens, full size washers and dryers, and weekly housekeeping, it’s easy to imagine staying longer. A prime position in Center City—steps from City Hall, historic Old City, the business district, and plenty of dining and shopping—makes Roost a supremely convenient place to post up while you’re in town. Less than a five minute walk away, the historic Reading Terminal Market sells Pennsylvania Dutch doughnuts, and one of the city’s best roast pork sandwiches.","['Give us an overview of the space here?\nHoused on five floors of an upscale residential building in the city’s centrally-located Midtown Village neighborhood, the spacious, meticulously-designed luxury apartments here are meant for extended stays, from a week to several months. With sunlit rooms, high-kitchens, full size washers and dryers, and weekly housekeeping, it’s easy to imagine staying longer.', ""What's the backstory?\nPhilly-based Method Co., founders of the Roost brand and local restaurants Wm. Mulherin’s Sons and \nHiroki\n, opened their third apartment hotel inside a Center City luxury residential building. Designed by Morris Adjmi, the New York-based architect also worked on the brand’s first two hotels, as well as the rest of the residential building, The Girard, so there’s a beautiful continuity to the design. (i.e., rooms don’t feel like they were just plunked down inside an existing apartment building—you’re getting the same vibe when you step foot in your apartment as you did when you walked through the building’s front door.)"", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nAll three room options—one bedroom, one bedroom with a den, and two bedrooms—offer a good deal more space than your average \nNew York City\n apartment. Each is flooded with natural light thanks to the apartment’s walls of windows. Furnishings (a buttery leather couch, walnut stools) and decor (a vintage Persian rug, one-of-a-kind artwork) all give the feeling that you’re staying at a stylish and well-traveled friend’s apartment. Extra amenities include an Apple TV, Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speakers, Bosch washers and dryers, and Davines bath products.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nEach apartment comes with complimentary, high-speed Wi-Fi, so there’s no need to borrow your neighbor’s.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe apartment hotel model usually means there’s no full-service restaurant on site, and Roost is no different. But the 24-hour front desk and concierge can direct guests to nearby dining destinations—the neighborhood has plenty. Less than a five minute walk from the Roost, the historic \nReading Terminal Market\n sells Pennsylvania Dutch doughnuts, and one of the city’s best roast pork sandwiches. If you’re not ready to face the world just yet, rooms are equipped with coffee programs, which include Chemex coffee makers and grinders, plus whole bean local \nLa Colombe\n coffee for brewing a stellar cup of coffee before having to change out of your pajamas.', 'And the service?\n While the vibe feels like an apartment building, the 24-hour front desk reminds you they’re in the hospitality business. Check in is warm and welcoming, and deciphering some of the room’s more technical amenities (the Bosch dishwasher, the Baratza Virtuoso coffee grinder) is a breeze with guidance from the staff.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\nExtended stay guests, including those in town on business, plus families making the move to Philly and still scoping out a permanent place to call home.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\nTucked into five floors of a residential building, the hotel fits seamlessly into the neighborhood of offices and high-rises. A prime position in Center City—steps from \nCity Hall\n, historic Old City, the business district, and plenty of dining and shopping—makes Roost a supremely convenient place to post up while you’re in town.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\nIf there was a soaking tub, I’d never leave. (Though the rainfall shower is perfectly soothing after a workout in the 24-hour fitness center.)"", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\nThe Roost has everything you want in an extended stay apartment: a full kitchen, in-unit washer and dryer, weekly housekeeping, and, most importantly, a beautifully-designed space in which you’d actually want to unpack and stay a while. But it’s also got a raft of amenities that feel like they belong in a boutique hotel, including a sizable outdoor, heated lap pool overlooking Market Street, a complimentary bike share, and an “amenity floor” that features a landscaped deck with a community vegetable garden, and grills for the city version of a backyard barbecue.', ""Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\n If you’re looking for a hotel for one night, or a weekend getaway, this probably isn't for you. (They usually host guests for a month or more, but the minimum stay is typically 7 to 10 days, depending on the time of year.) But if you’re after a spacious home base, impeccably-designed and loaded with luxe amenities that will make you feel like you’re staying in a dream version of your own pied-a-terre, this is your place.""]","1199 Ludlow Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/philadelphia/roost-east-market,https://myroost.com/

That said, try to secure a room with a park view—because of the building's cantilevered facade, interior rooms contain pointed corner nooks (occupied by a desk or a table and chairs) that either feel like a spacious refuge or a Feng shui nightmare.

Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia at Comcast Center,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"This is a Four Seasons, so you can expect seamless service and a lot of greige carpeting. However, this particular outpost is somewhat unique in that so many big names were tapped for its creation: floral designer Jeff Leatham, composer Brian Eno, architect Norman Foster, and chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Greg Vernick. Their contributions along with expansive skyline views from every vantage point on the property and passionate, genuine service could make this the beginning of a transformation of Philadelphia's hotel scene. ","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\n Pulling up to the hotel, I’ll admit: I was a little nonplussed. Outside, it looks a lot like any other skyscraper that just happens to have ‘Four Seasons’ stamped across the entry. But as we began to shoot up to the 60th-floor sky lobby at more than a floor per second, with Ben Franklin Parkway flying into view through the elevator’s glass wall, I started to shed my skepticism. When we finally reached the top, and I found myself looking out over an enormous swath of Philadelphia, with Jeff Leatham-designed floral arrangements framing my path to the check-in desk, I conceded total defeat. Basically, it blew me away."", ""What's the backstory?\n This is a Four Seasons: Expect seamless service and a lot of greige carpeting. However, this particular Four Seasons is somewhat unique in that so many big names were tapped for its creation: floral designer Jeff Leatham, composer Brian Eno, architect Norman Foster, and chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Greg Vernick. Each of the elements these folks have contributed, whether a dedicated musical score, meticulous floral arrangements, or a global food profile, has merged to make this project feel singular and special. It’s not often that Philly feels like the center of the world, but it does here."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n Our Landmark Corner Suite was gorgeous: light and bright, elegant but unstuffy. The king-size bed had a pristine, cloud-white duvet and sheets; by the foot of it sat a lounge chair and ottoman ideal for reading. We also had a small living room that could be separated from the bedroom area with a sliding white leather door; had we stayed longer, the two rooms and their two TVs probably would’ve been useful for our great E! versus ESPN divide. Honey-colored wooden accent walls felt sculptural and modern; they curved around the room in a way that enhanced the abundant views, which were easily the best part. From almost every vantage point, we could see some sliver of the city: the tip of Billy Penn’s hat, One Liberty Place, Ben Franklin Parkway (from the bathtub!), even Eastern State Penitentiary. And, unlike New York, there’s very little in the way of height competition, so the vistas are more or less unobstructed. You really feel like you’re just sitting in the sky. The hotel also gets serious bonus points for techy touches like a volume knob in the bathroom (so you can listen to the news while you're in the shower without cranking the TV) and the switches next to the bed that control the blackout shades as well as the lights."", ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n There are a few different ways to game the F&B here. We only spent one night in the hotel, so we opted to eat at Jean-Georges on the 59th floor, and the de facto star of the sunken lobby. For JG fans, the food is reminiscent of the manicured fine dining at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's other eponymous restaurants around the world. We went all out and ordered the seven-course summer tasting menu, and enjoyed a steady, three-hour deployment of small dishes like tuna tartare with chili oil and sautéed Maine lobster in an unctuous Aleppo pepper-garlic broth. Given more time I would’ve loved to have tried Vernick Fish, the downstairs restaurant run by local favorite Greg Vernick, but alas, we could only consume so many meals in a day."", 'And the service?\nThe service sits apart from other hotels of its caliber—in the best way. It’s on-point and enthusiastic, sure, but genuine, too. The hotel just opened, so maybe that’s what accounts for it, but there’s a real atmosphere of excitement, and the staff seems to want to represent the greatest manifestation of the Four Seasons brand. Many of them are Philadelphia natives, too, and expressed the spirit of generosity that exists in the city. There are a few staff members I’d like to single out: Josie, who showed us to our room, was a delight; Charles, one of the valets, who tended to us while we were waiting for our car, bringing us water and loading our bags; and Anthony at the front desk. I’m sure there are more, but that’s who I remember specifically. All three were incredibly attentive and kind, and exemplified exactly what you expect from Four Seasons service.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\n Look around, and you’ll likely spot thirtysomethings who grew up along Philadelphia’s tony Main Line and are in town for the weekend to attend an old friend’s wedding: think, petite blondes in Ralph Lauren shifts, and their handsome, stocky husbands all gussied up in Brooks Brothers. There were Penn parents, too, likely moving their kids into college that weekend.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n The Four Seasons is less than a 10-minute walk from the Ben Franklin Parkway, where you’ll find museums like the \nBarnes\n, the \nRodin\n, and, of course, the \nPhiladelphia Museum of Art\n, which is great. But the central location is at once expected and surprising; the former because the families, couples, and businesspeople who are putting their feet up here for the night will no doubt want to do some sightseeing during the day; the latter because of how quiet the hotel’s cross street actually is. It \nis\n a bit of a hike—about a 30-minute walk—from the Liberty Bell and Independence Park, but of course, you could just have the hotel’s Tesla service drop you off there…', ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\n I didn’t bring my bathing suit, but I should have; the infinity-edge pool on the 57th floor is \nnot\n to be missed. I also didn’t make it to the gym, but it’s a beautiful one, with a wall of eight televisions and again, those inescapable views of the city. Next time, I’d also pencil in a drink at the sky lobby bar, which predictably becomes a swanky late-night scene where the locals flock for a proper cocktail and a background for the night’s requisite IG post. I also got to know the hotel's pet policy when two Philly-based friends booked a suite at the hotel to celebrate their engagement while we were there, and the hotel was kind enough to accommodate their pup with treats and a dog bed."", 'One thing I loved about this hotel—and maybe it’s due to its newness—is how Philadelphians, themselves, are taken with it. During our dinner at Jean-Georges, no fewer than five couples made their way through the dining room; not to eat, but just to take pictures of the views. One couple even lugged their baby, who was in a carrier, next to our table by the window for a family selfie. I couldn’t help but volunteer to snap a family portrait; I was moved by the fact that they were excited enough about the hotel to schlep their baby up 60 floors, down a set of steep-ish stairs, and through a restaurant, just to take it all in.', 'Bottom line: Worth it?\n I’d like to put up fliers to tell people about this place. It really is special, and full of the kinds of people who care about making your experience—both at the hotel, and in Philadelphia itself—as perfect as possible (with just the right amount of fuss).

For a hotel with over 700 rooms (amazingly, it doesn’t feel like it), each manages to feel classically luxurious without steering into the cold or cookie-cutter. Plush beds, desertscape artwork, and bulbous ceramic lamps all over make the room feel both set in the Southwest and tony enough for a Waldorf. For a resort where you plan to stay on-site most of your time, the food has to deliver—by and large, it does. McArthur’s serves reliable American classics, though Renata's Hearth with its smoke-inspired menu is the place to dress up and dine at after a long day in the sun. You could come here just for the spa, where they lean into astrology, crystals, and chakra opening in a big way, resulting in massages and body work that are just that much more interesting than the usual offerings. There are unsurprisingly a ton of families here thanks to family-friendly features like connecting rooms, activities and areas just for children (such as the very popular kids’ pool), and the ease with which parents can take turns escaping for a yoga or pickleball class (it’s a very big place). That said, no matter how great the spa treatments are, nothing can melt away stress like flinging yourself down the waterslides—don’t write them off as just for kids. From $299. —Megan Spurrell","['Why book?\n This historic hotel—built in 1929 by an architect who studied under Frank Lloyd Wright—has seen decades of desert glamor and celebrity, but a much-needed refresh means the amenities speak to today’s travelers: there’s an adults-only pool and a massive waterslide for kids, a mezcal and Pan-Latin restaurant, and a new-age spa with astrology-inspired treatments.', 'Set the scene\n I jetted in from the Phoenix airport to the Phoenix burb where this giant property is located—there’s no need to really leave. You’re here to be here, though the surrounding desert landscape and Piestewa peak in full view behind the main lawn deliver the you’re-in-Arizona memo. Walking the snaking passageways from one building to another, you’ll see families with small kids toddling toward the Twister waterslide, bachelorettes booking out cabanas at the adults-only Saguaro pool, couples unwinding over lazing brisket dinners, and conference attendees power-walking through the hallways as they plot out how to escape to the mister-covered Spire Bar at some point.', 'The backstory\n Built in 1929 by Albert Chase McArthur, this hotel has seen it all—Marilyn Monroe by the pool, Jerry Seinfield at dinner, Frank Sinatra playing the lobby piano. But a 15-month renovation, completed in Spring 2023, restored the resort to its former shine, and then some. There are entirely new bars and restaurants, a lux gym and spa, and even brand-new pools—though a 140-year-old Saguaro remains at the adults-only pool. Of course, the historic modern-meets-desert architectural style anchors it all, for a stay with a little more sentimentality than your average resort.', 'The rooms\n For a hotel with over 700 rooms (amazingly, it doesn’t feel like it), each manages to feel classically luxurious without steering into the cold or cookie-cutter. Plush beds, desert-scape artwork, and bulbous ceramic lamps all-over the room feel both set in the Southwest, but tony enough for a Waldorf Astoria. Stay in a Citrus Club room for lounge access (it’s pretty legit), or book a bungalow for a little extra privacy.', ""Food and drink\n For a resort where you plan to stick on-site most of your time, the food has to deliver—by and large, it does. McArthur’s serves reliable American classics, though Renata's Hearth with its smoke-inspired menu is the place to dress up and dine at after a long day in the sun (the eight-hour brisket was fantastic; so was the Los Muertos cocktail)."", 'The spa\n You could come here just for the spa. They’ve leaned into astrology, crystals, and chakra-opening in a big way. The treatment menu veers on sounding like a parody of Goop-y wellness culture, but the result is massages and body work that are just that much more interesting than the usual offerings. Ultimately, it works. I did both the Alchemy Mud & Crystal wrap, and a Chakra & Sound massage—while the first analyzed my horoscope and personality, a fun proposition, I found the chakra the best balance of new age wisdom and standard spa fare. I learned about my energy, sure, but really, it was one of the best massages I’ve had. And, if you can bear to work out on vacation, the gym next door is state-of-the-art.', 'The neighborhood/area\n Phoenix is constantly growing and ever-expanding—just as writer Chris Malloy has covered for \nTraveler\n (check out his \nnew guide to Phoenix\n). I struggled to leave the pool, but with a couple more days I definitely would have headed to the Heard Museum for Native American art, or hopped around eating great Mexican food.', 'The service\n Saying the staff are the highlight of a property feels like a cliché—so many kind, friendly people work in hospitality, and I’ve been spoiled by my experiences.

In 2018, developers began transforming the existing structures into a hotel, adding a pool area and main building where the current front desk-slash-popsicle stand sits today.

Adero Scottsdale,"Hot List, 2021.",2,"With easy access to 55,000 acres of hiking and biking trails that criss-cross the saguaro-studded Sonoran landscape, days at the new Adero Scottsdale are made for outdoor adventures. But it’s after the seemingly alway-shining Arizona sun finally sets that things really get exciting. The hotel is the rare property to open within a Dark Sky community (of which Arizona only has a handful); this means, in layperson terms, that you’ll have access to some killer stargazing. The hotel’s on-site Dark Sky experts (fondly referred to as “Star Dudes”) lead stargazing sessions. For self-guided tours of the galaxy, telescopes along with daily night sky charts can be delivered to guest rooms; 177 of them, kitted out in desert hues with a midcentury vibe (Frank Lloyd Wright’s home Taliesin West is just a few miles away). If sipping while looking skyward is preferable, the outdoor lawn and patio at the hotel’s bar-restaurant Cielo, is a solid place to watch the surrounding McDowell Mountains turn a sherbety shade as the stars take the stage for the late show.","['Why book?\n With endless views of Arizona’s famed Four Peaks and McDowell Mountain Range, this property calls out to lovers of nature and the outdoors. Start off with sunrise yoga on the lawn overlooking Adero Canyon and then head off for a day of exploring the trails before making your way back to the resort for some pool time to unwind before dressing up for sunset cocktails right back on that same yoga lawn.', 'Set the scene:\n There’s a mixture of young professionals and experienced locals who don’t mind paying $18 to $24 per cocktail, and who truly are there for the setting, as well as the surrounding hiking trails. Lots of Lululemon during the day that transforms into chic cocktail attire as the sun dims and the surrounding skies turn from blue to pink to black. The hotel is located in one of only a handful of \ndark sky communities\n in Arizona, which means you will get some amazing stargazing opportunities. On property, guests can book an evening experience with ‘Star Dudes’ guides who come equipped with the latest telescopes so that guests can take a closer look at the distant lights from space in the darkness of our skies. Warning to those who try to look through a telescope after having a few cocktails, it’s not easy.', 'The backstory:\n Formerly the CopperWynd Resort, all that is left of the once privately owned hotel are the original rooms, now named Cliffside Guestrooms, which are located in the adults only wing of the resort next to the new tower. Those original beloved rooms will maintain their private fireplaces and entrances. Following an extensive and expensive redo, the new resort is a year-round getaway for travelers that seek adventure alongside creative comforts.', 'The rooms:\n Large, modern, with lots of exposed concrete and a solid nod to the desert’s love affair with mid-century mod. All the rooms and suites come with oversized balconies, and if you’re in a corner unit like I was, there’s enough outdoor space to host a group of friends. The hotel does encourage guests to use the binoculars and telescope provided in each room, and with stunning views of the surrounding mountain ranges, it should almost be mandatory. The bathrooms are magical. The corner suite had a massive walk-in shower with direct access to the tub.', 'Food and drink:\n The views from both Cielo, the full service restaurant, and Sky Top, the outdoor lawn bar with small bites, are part of the experience; make sure to book ahead of time if you want the best seat to watch the sun set. The menus at Cielo are distinctive enough to provide variety for guests dining there for all three meals. The pool bar, Revive, does a cantaloupe colada that truly hits the spot.', 'The spa:\n Treatments at the spa are named after, and rooted in, desert minerals, local herbs and Native American healing traditions and are intended to restore body, mind and spirit. The hotel gym has its own Peloton studio for those who can’t go a day without their daily ride.', ""The neighborhood/area:\n Although the property adopted “Scottsdale” as part of its name, the hotel is surrounded by the very tight community of Fountain Hills. Once a primarily private planned community of homes with dramatic views of the area's extensive mountain ranges, it’s now a fast-growing area of the larger Phoenix-Scottsdale metropolitan area. Depending on which locals you ask, the hotel’s transformation from family-run to corporate (now under the Marriott flag) has left some residents uneasy about the added foot and car traffic. Although, to be fair, this is something that isn’t solely on the hotel since Adero Canyon is located next door and has gotten more popular with residents as more people these days have been \nspending time exploring the outdoors\n. The trailheads range from simple to expert level with some insane inclines that will lead you to be one with your thoughts and the heat--bring plenty of water. The hotel does have a small trail accessible from the Sky Top Lounge garden lawn, but it’s intended for kids or those with zero hiking experience. Everyone else can hop on the hotel shuttle for a free drop off at the trailheads, or get there on their own; it’s a 20-minute uphill walk away from the property itself."", 'The service:\n Although the Adero grew from just a handful of accommodations to 177 guest rooms and suites with the addition of the new tower, you’ll still find that the hotel staff will get to know you by name. It always seemed like whoever you ran into in the hallways was ready to point you in the right direction. Someone you should definitely get to know prior to your arrival is the resort’s very own Adventure Concierge who can arrange tours and get you set up with whatever type of gear you need (they have a partnership with REI) for your outdoor adventures in the area. The concierge can also lead you to less-wandered trails and secret spots that haven’t made the guidebooks or online forums just yet.', 'Eco effort:\n Expect to find water stations next to the elevators on every level, encouraging guests to refill their reusable water containers. Beyond this, no other visible efforts were noticed.', 'Anything left to mention?\n If lounging by the pool all day, plan to chase the sun that will start off strongly over the family pool and then make its way towards the adults only pool before disappearing. With the pools virtually next to one another, it makes for an easy transition.']","3225 N Eagle Ridge Dr, Scottsdale, Arizona 85268, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/scottsdale/adero-scottsdale,https://www.aderoscottsdale.com/

Ground-floor patio rooms come with just that, and there are several suites of different sizes, including the 900-square-foot Sundeck Suite with a full living room and private rooftop terrace.', 'Food and drink', 'The most design-centric portion of the property is the new Tia Carmen, a glam Tulum-esque indoor-outdoor eatery centered around contemporary Southwestern cuisine. Here, \nTop Chef\n alum Angelo Sosa has created plays on dishes inspired by his real-life Tia Carmen, many of them infused with smoky flavors from the wood-fired grill, like the mesquite-smoked chicken and the must-order grilled whole trout served alongside a punchy oregano-and-parsley sauce. Day to day the kitchen is under the leadership of talented chef de cuisine Penny Tagliarina, who’s added some of her own dishes—like a ceviche tostada and grilled head-on prawns over a creamy corn puree – to the menu. Pair them with a pretty paloma done with yuzu and bergamot or an aguachile margarita. For more casual options, the lobby restaurant and bar Twenty6 has a mixed menu of appetizers, flatbreads, and salads and is always humming with groups inside at communal tables or outside on the fire pit-laden patio, where you’ll find live music some nights.

Later this year look for chef Sosa to open a new Asian concept on the property.', 'The spa', 'There’s a solid selection of treatments here ranging from specialty massages including one that incorporates bamboo sticks and ginger oil. Body treatments reflect desert ingredients – like the Prickly Pear Sugar Scrub and the Turquoise Cocoon that utilizes a sage desert salt body polish. While the locker rooms aren’t as luxurious as many other hotel spas in town, they’re serviceable and have everything you need to relax thanks to steam rooms, saunas, and hot tubs, plus an attentive staff. The pool here is a tranquil hidden gem and, even if you don’t opt for a treatment, it’s worth the nominal $35 day fee to have access to what I found to be the nicest – and quietest -- pool currently on property, only open to adults.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'Situated in North \nPhoenix\n, the resort is within walking distance of Desert Ridge Marketplace, an outdoor mall of mainly chain stores and restaurants, and a short drive to the more upscale High Street, home to many independent retail and dining options.

When a civic group formed to preserve Camelback Mountain and eliminate development above the 1,700-foot level, the property owners transferred a chunk of their acreage to the preserve to help the cause, where it remains today. After changing names and majority owners a few times over the years, the property closed in 2000 and reopened the following year under new management as Sanctuary, with 82 new casitas as well as its current restaurant, bar, and pool. The spa followed in 2002. The resort is now under the umbrella of Gurney’s Resorts, with a sister property in Montauk, New York.', 'The rooms', 'There are lots of room categories to choose from here—from traditional rooms (dubbed casitas) to one-and-two-bedroom suites to private villas—all giving off midcentury vibes with slump stone walls, light woods, and a mix of chic furnishings done in a neutral color palette. Bathrooms boast glass showers and separate soaking tubs against black lacquer tile. The higher you go, the better the views, and you can’t go wrong with the mountain suite with its fireplace, floor-to ceiling windows, separate bedroom and living room, and a wrap-around balcony you won’t want to leave.', 'Food and drink', 'If you can snag a table at sunset on the outdoor patio of restaurant Elements, \ndo it.\n Watching the dramatic peaks of the \nPhoenix\n Mountains Preserve change color as the lights of the valley come to life is a transformative experience. The menu emphasizes seasonal dishes with global influences like a five-spice glazed pork chop alongside kimchi veggies, a classic colossal shrimp cocktail, and cacio e pepe gnudi spiked with chanterelles and black truffles, a dish that I’m still daydreaming about. Jade Bar is a hot spot for happy hour, but if you want to take in the view, you’ll need to sit at table in the lounge as the bar is facing the opposite direction. The bar team relies on fresh produce and herbs like the Little Leaf, a zippy refresher mixed with mezcal, cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeño.', 'The spa', 'The full-service spa with 10 indoor and outdoor treatment rooms is permeated with Asian influences in its interior design—there’s a central stone courtyard with a reflection pond and Zen meditation garden—and its treatment menu. Some of the more unique options include the Tok Sen massage, which blends Thai massage with vibration therapy,\xa0and the Golden Lotus Balancing Ritual that infuses herbal medicine and includes a wrap of healing herbs followed by a full-body massage using herbal cream.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The Sanctuary lives up to its name. It’s a tranquil property that feels super secluded and yet is only a short ride to Downtown Scottsdale. It’s also accessible to a variety of hiking trails and walking paths on Camelback.', 'The service', 'There if you need them, but far from fussy, service here is solid. And since the hotel is spread out vertically with many rooms perched on a hill, there are always multiple members of the valet team standing by to take you anywhere on property via golf cart. Service at Elements is especially attentive.', 'For families', 'The resort definitely skews more adult than family-oriented.

Conference-goers are often ducking in and out of the big ballrooms day and night and the lobby is nearly always abuzz with travelers coming and going. Outside, golfers zip down cart paths as they traverse the 71-par course, and the pickle ball and tennis courts are in use most of the year.', 'The backstory', 'When he began construction of the property in the mid-1980s, developer Charles Keating went over-the-top, importing the lobby’s marble floor from Carrera, Italy and spending $1 million on mother-of-pearl tiles that line one of the pools. The resort began a three-year renovation in 2016, remodeling all of its rooms, lobby, and complex and building a new three-story spa and 4,600-square-foot standalone fitness facility, which opened in 2018.', 'The rooms', 'Even the standard guest rooms have a good amount of space (starting at 600 square), and the style feels contemporary and understated with rooms done in tan desert hues with natural stone glass showers, double sink vanities, and oval tubs, plus large balconies or patios. Go for one overlooking the pool in the main building, or against the boulders on the backside of the complex across from the main entrance. Guests can also opt for casita rooms and suites set within multiple two-story buildings spread out around the property (some of which come with fire tables on their private patios), or book accommodations at the separate and more intimate Canyon Suites, with just 60 total rooms and suites, where you’ll get access to an exclusive pool and breakfast spread.', 'Food and drink', 'The all-day Mowry & Cotton with its upscale Americana interior and expansive patio has an approachable menu of seasonal salads, steaks, seafood, and flatbreads from the wood-burning oven along with crafty cocktails including a smoked Old Fashioned that’s torched tableside. For something higher-end, head up to the J&G Steakhouse, which boasts big-time views from its fifth-floor location. The menu is centered around classic steakhouse fare and decadent dishes like a Wagyu Tomahawk ribeye, sauteed Dover sole, and lobster-laced mac and cheese. Downstairs, the lobby’s Thirsty Camel bar—with its daily live music and backdrop of glass overlooking the resort and surrounding scenery, plus a patio dotted with fire features—becomes a prime people-watching spot just about every night of the week. The lobby also hosts a traditional high tea service Thursday to Sunday afternoons accompanied by a live piano player.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'You’ve got one of the Phoenix area’s most popular hikes—Camelback Mountain—right in your backyard, along with some of the area’s most magnificent (and expensive) homes. Old Town Scottsdale is just a quick and easy ride away.', 'The service', 'Polished and on the formal side, the service here is always on. Multiple concierge members can help point you where you need to go, make dinner reservations around town, or set up something special.', 'For families', 'The resort is family-friendly, with a selection of daily children’s activities at the kids’ club and a separate splash pad pool area with a waterslide, shooting waterspouts, treehouse and more. Still, adults without children definitely seem to outnumber guests here with little ones.', 'Accessibility', 'There are a total of 21 hearing accessible rooms, 18 mobility accessible rooms within the main resort, and six ADA rooms within Canyon Suites.', 'The Spa', 'It’s worth booking a treatment just to have access to this stunner of a spa (clocking in at 40,000 square feet with more than two dozen treatment rooms). The facilities feel super luxe with art, sculpture-like sconces, iridescent mosaic tiles, and skylights throughout and well-stocked lavish locker rooms. Expect a long menu of treatments including massages, facials, and body treatments along with some signature offerings. (I loved the Phoenix Rising, a combo of a gentle scrub with a magnesium-rich body polish and a full-body massage.) There’s also a placid rooftop pool with a bistro where you can order salads, snacks, and smoothies. After your treatment, hit the hydrotherapy area for a round of sauna, steam, a circulation-boosting cold shower, and hot tubbing.', 'Anything left to mention?', 'The gleaming new fitness center is one of the most impressive I’ve experienced at a hotel, possibly ever. Made up almost entirely of TechnoGym equipment, there are more elliptical machines, treadmills, weight machines, and Peloton bikes than there are gym-goers so you can access anything you want without ever having to wait.

That’s what you’re sleeping in when you book the School Wing, but instead of too-small chairs, there are comfortable beds, zany wall murals, and private bathrooms. The hotel quiets down once the local restaurant-goers clear out in the evening, leaving the halls largely deserted except for the occasional robe-clad guest returning from the soaking pool. For the quietest stay—sans the historic charms and chalkboards—request one of the 22 rooms in the newer English Wing.', 'What about the in-room amenities?\nAmenities are basic; there’s no television or minibar, but Wi-Fi is free and reasonably fast.', ""What's the food and drink scene like?\nThe hotel serves three meals a day and has a half-dozen bars (at some point, drink a Botanical Mule in the Boiler Room), so if all you’re in the market for is simple, unfussy pub grub and decent booze in an entertaining environment, you needn’t leave campus. For pickier palates, the surrounding streets are rife with top restaurants; for casual, family-friendly eats, head down artsy-cool Alberta Street to Pine State Biscuits for gravy-drenched biscuit sandwiches the size of a softball, Bollywood Theater for Indian street-food favorites, or \nProud Mary,\n a hip Australian import with a true connoisseur-grade coffee selection and Instagram-breaking ricotta hotcake."", ""Anything stand out about other services and features?\nEspecially tempting for guests in staycation mode, the heated year-round saltwater soaking pool in the hotel’s private outdoor garden courtyard (formerly the teachers' lounge) is open all day; although the public is invited until 8pm, later in the evening it might just be all yours. Over in the auditorium-turned–second-run movie theater, cozy old sofas and armchairs are lined up in place of squeaky stadium seats; after you order at the bar, your burger and beer will be delivered right to your seat. Best of all? Admission Is free for guests (but even if it wasn’t, flicks cost only $4 for the public, and half that for kids)."", ""What's the bottom line?\nWith a soaking pool, movie theater, and onsite brewery, this converted elementary school is the educational experience of our dreams.""]","5736 NE 33rd Ave, Portland, Oregon 97211, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/united-states/portland/mcmenamins-kennedy-school,https://www.mcmenamins.com/kennedy-school

These days, Clyde Common has been temporarily reimagined as Clyde Tavern and Common Market; the Tavern tackles happy hour and dinner Wednesday through Saturday, serving a curated list of Morgenthaler's greatest hits alongside chef Chris DiMinno's\xa0expert twists on comfort food classics—French fries buried in a rich lamb-pork sugo and three kinds of cheese, crispy-skinned roast chicken with creamy kale and local chanterelles, Calabrian chile-spiced Dungeness crab spaghettini, and the beloved house burger.

If more space is a requisite, book a Junior Suite; if you’re a light sleeper, request the quietest room possible—the friendly staff is happy to oblige.', 'How about the little things, like the wifi, mini bar, or shower goodies?\nWi-Fi is free and fast, the cushy pillowtop mattresses are wrapped in luxurious Italian-made Mascioni linens, the pillow menu lets you pick between soft, medium, firm, or extra firm, in-room Nespresso coffee machines mean no stumbling downstairs to get your wake-up cup, Tivoli Bluetooth Clock Players let you stream your own Portland playlist, \nSalt & Straw\n ice cream delivery is available around the clock, and the minibar is a locavore’s dream. Plus, you’ll get a $5 minibar credit for each day you pass on housekeeping.', ""Anything stand out about other services and features?\nYour fitness routine needn’t falter just because you’re out of town—the gym is equipped with live-streaming Peloton bikes, and the Well+Fit kits have a Manduka yoga mat, barre3 bands, weights, a core ball, and an iPad loaded with workouts by barre3 and The Lab X Burn. Or, if you'd prefer to get out and about, ask the staff about discounted local studio passes or borrow one of the hotel’s Shinola bicycles—it’s an easy pedal down to Tom McCall Waterfront Park’s riverfront trail, then onward to the booming inner Southeast industrial district.""]","400 SW Broadway, Portland, Oregon 97205, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/portland/portland/hotel-lucia,https://hotellucia.com/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Unlike with other properties on Puerto Rico's resort-heavy north shore, Dorado Beach's emphasis is on its setting. The resort has undergone many transformations (including after Hurricane Maria in 2017), but since Laurance Rockefeller built a sanctuary here it has been all about sea, sand, and green spaces. Rooms are bookended by beach-facing terraces and outdoor showers, and museum-quality art is scattered on tree branches. But it’s the Spa Botánico, a tropical wonderland that’s much more than the usual cluster of treatment rooms, that really sticks to Rockefeller’s approach. After visiting, you’ll remember the 95-year-old ficus at the entrance most clearly. That or the tree house in the canopy where you had the greatest massage of your life. ","[""Set the scene: What's this place all about?\nThe linear palms and manicured golf greens signal that the enclave of Dorado is different from others on the island. And indeed, it is: This is a luxury gated community where crypto-millionaires spend their downtime. The Ritz-Carlton Reserve here feels removed, yet the hotel is actually more plugged-in than it appears. Wood-planked walkways, a lily pond, and curated greenery welcome guests upon arrival, while ocean views and a two-mile stretch of sand immediately instill a sense of tranquility. Upon arrival, a staffer holds out a tray of tropical popsicles as a first touch of hospitality."", ""What's the backstory?\nThis land, first developed as a pineapple, grapefruit, and coconut plantation in 1905, it didn't become a resort until 1958, when tycoon Laurance Rockefeller developed it as a hotel and nature preserve. In 2012, Ritz-Carlton transformed it into its first Reserve property in the Americas. After Hurricane Maria, the resort closed for one year, reopening in October 2018 following a multi-million-dollar renovation."", ""How are the rooms? Any tips on what to book?\nEven the entry-level rooms are huge—nearly 1,000 square feet—and all embrace the natural surroundings with ample terraces and giant picture windows offering cinematic views of the ocean, along with outdoor and beach access. Outfitted with wood and marble, the interior design's coffee and sand tones defer to the vivid greens and brilliant blues outside. Water elements are abundant; all rooms include indoor and outdoor rainforest showers along with soaking tubs; some also feature private plunge pools. Villas and residences kick up the luxury with golf carts and private chefs for hire. The extravagant 8,000-square-foot Su Casa villa, recently renovated by Champalimaud, is the preferred stay for V-VIPs."", 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nWi-Fi is included in the $125-a-day resort fee.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nThe resort has made a post-hurricane commitment to increase local sourcing in its four restaurants, which include Coa, a grill concept with one of the largest wine cellars in the Caribbean; the Asian-influenced Positivo, where a sand floor nods to the idea of beach-to-table dining; and the family-friendly Encanto. If you want to do some of the work yourself, guests can participate in cooking classes at La Cocina Culinary Center.', 'And the service?\n Every room is assigned an \nembajador\n, a personal butler charged with enhancing experiences. They can arrange everything from helicopter tours to private yacht bookings to family photoshoots on the beach.', 'Who tends to stay here?\nWell-heeled golfers with their spouses and families; cashed-up honeymooners whose parents paid for their room as a wedding gift; Ritz-Carlton loyalists from all over the world.', ""Where's the hotel located, and what is there to do in the surrounding area?\nWhile it feels self-contained amid its 1,400 acres, the property abuts the residential Dorado Beach Resort & Club where guests can take advantage of more amenities, including Melao, a restaurant by celebrated local chef Mario Pagan. Downtown Dorado has every shop and service vital to a thriving community."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nThe $125 resort fee seems high for a property that already has top-tier room rates."", ""Anything other features worth a mention?\nWe've been hinting at it, but Dorado is the go-to golf hub for the island. There are three pro courses, one designed by Robert Trent Jones and another by his son, Robert Trent Jones Jr. Other diversions are equally first-rate, such as the five-acre Spa Botanico, a paradise unto itself with treatment treehouses; the 11-mile Rockefeller Nature Trail, a haven for hikers, joggers, and cyclists (with free bikes provided by the property); the Watermill aquatic playground for kids; tennis courts; two pools; and watersports."", 'Bottom line: Worth it?

Cruise ships dock at the foot of the city and sailboats offers tours that showcase the best views. The Cataño ferry shuttles rum lovers across the bay to Casa Bacardi (\nthat\n Bacardi).', ""Anything perks if we stay here?\nIf you're craving the beach the hotel provides access (and transport) to La Concha Resort in Condado and Courtyard by Marriott's blue flag beach in Isla Verde."", ""So why would you recommend this hotel, and who for?\nThere's nowhere else in the United States where one can stay in a nearly 400-year-old building in a 500 year-old city.

But the $50 million that Hyatt pumped in to relaunch the fabled resort last year means it now includes an updated 15,000 square foot spa with knock out Swedish massages and a sharp new Californian bistro, Ember and Rye, where the barbecued oysters go well with their Sonoma chardonnays. Of course there is plenty to keep the kids happy too, including a totally reimagined pool area with waterslides and a badminton area. And nice to know, too, that should moms and dads want to escape down the bluff for a night out knocking back beers with the local surfers, Aviara has a squad of babysitters at the ready. Doubles from $599. —Michelle Gross","['Why book?\n One of north county \nSan Diego’s\n most elegant resorts, Park Hyatt Aviara Resort, Golf Club & Spa ups the ante in all things luxury.', 'Set the scene:\n Set on 200-acres in the sleepy surf town of Carlsbad, California, Park Hyatt Aviara Resort, Golf Club & Spa has been a perennial favorite of moneyed travelers, sports enthusiasts and the San Diego staycation set thanks to its world-renowned Aviara Golf Club and destination spa. You know you’ve arrived somewhere special from the moment you set foot in the grand foyer. Wide-open spaces and an indoor-outdoor living room concept seamlessly blend California-coastal cool and palatial beach home.', 'Attracting golfers and tennis enthusiasts to the 18-hole Arnold Palmer designed course and state of the art tennis facility, the hotel is beloved by couples thanks to the expansive spa and swoon-worthy adults only pool and cabanas. Also ideal for families, the main pool now offers a brand-new waterslide tower and tide-pool splash pad area, a great amenity for kids of all ages to spend some fun in the sun. For solo travelers, there’s an abundance of included activities to keep you occupied ranging from nightly meditation classes to yoga and guided walks around the Batiquitos lagoon.', ""Now in the home stretch of completing a multi-year renovation that’s seen a total overhaul of the resort's common spaces, guest rooms, pools and restaurants, Aviara as it’s lovingly referred to by locals, now shines better and brighter than ever."", 'The backstory:\n Originally part of the Four Seasons chain of luxury hotels and resorts, Hyatt acquired the hotel in 2010, and while this has always been a uniquely upscale offering in low-key San Diego, it wasn’t until the recent $50-million renovation that Aviara has really started to come into its own.', 'Today, the Four Seasons Residence Club still remains down the street from the hotel, and set in the affluent Carlsbad neighborhood of the same name, the Aviara continues to serve as a popular wedding destination for couples as well as hosting the LGPA Tournament every year. While San Diego will always be considered more subdued compared to its neighbors in Laguna and Newport Beach, with the recent remodel, Aviara is now a beacon for the luxury travel set that will surely give its splashy competitors to the north a run for their money.', 'The rooms:\n Boasting 327-spacious guestrooms, including 43 suites, the rooms here have been completely redesigned, and much like the rest of the hotel experience offers all the low-key luxury vibes you could hope for. Even starting rooms here are spacious, and if you’re looking for easy access to all the hotel has to offer, or if you’re traveling with pets, you might want to consider a room on the main floor which comes with your own furnished terrace space. The marble bathrooms, jacuzzi tubs and separate living room as well as balcony views of the Pacific Ocean found in the coastal view rooms are just a few of the perks of staying here.', 'Food and drink:\n Formerly home to Argyle, one of the area’s most beloved steakhouses, the resort’s new signature restaurant, Ember & Rye officially opens its doors this Spring. Featuring a collaboration with chef Richard Blais, the restaurant, will be located in the Aviara Golf Club and offer a fusion of high-end coastal cuisine with menu highlights that include barbecued oysters “flambadou” served with bone marrow butter and pickled chili along with a beverage program highlighting exclusive wines from prominent California winemakers. The hotel will also offer two more casual dining outposts including Baja-California inspired Ponto Lago available for breakfast, dinner and weekend brunch, as well as Pacific Point, a nod to Pacific Rim fare with standout dishes ranging from octopus poke and Wagyu short rib to roasted mochi carrots.', 'The spa:\n Aviara Spa spans some 15,000 square-feet and with 20-treatment rooms, an indoor solarium lounge, saunas and steam rooms, is well-worth a visit in and of itself. Though it specializes in all things Swedish and deep tissue massage, facials are considered some of the best in the area and include everything from the age-defying to the illuminating. For something truly unique to the area, don’t miss the “strawberry fields” facial which infuses locally grown strawberries to hydrate and plump the skin leaving it smoother and softer than ever.', 'The neighborhood/area:\n Set on 200-acres atop a bluff overlooking Batiquitos Lagoon and the Pacific Ocean in the distance, Aviara is located in a quiet residential neighborhood. One of the best kept secrets about this locale is that it’s located near a popular walking trail along the Batiquitos Lagoon. It’s a great 3-mile out-and-back trail that’s the perfect way to start or end your day. If you don’t feel like huffing it back up the hill to the resort, the hotel shuttle service is available to scoop you up at the entrance of the Aviara Golf Club and bring you back up. Also a short drive away, \nLEGOLAND\n is a big draw for families visiting the area as is a day spent at Ponto State Beach. Another unique seasonal attraction that’s well worth your visit is a walk through \nThe Flower Fields\n which offers 50-acres of Instagrammable moments from blueberry picking to walking amongst the rows and rows of flowers in bloom in the spring.', 'The service:\n Bar none, Park Hyatt Aviara offers some of the best service you’re likely to experience in San Diego. The hotel’s ethos of being the premier low-key luxury resort in town is truly reflected in the staff who will go out of their way to make you feel both pampered and right at home in equal measure. The hotel does offer a shuttle service and golf carts to get to and from the Golf Club and tennis facilities on property which is a nice option as those amenities are relatively spread out.', 'For families:\n An excellent option for families, the resort is well-suited for kids of all ages. With endless activities ranging from two brand new Top Golf suites to a family pool area that now offers a fantastic waterslide tower reminiscent of something you’d find at a luxury resort in \nMexico\n or the \nCaribbean\n, there’s no shortage of fun to be had. Located at the Aviara Golf Club, a recreation center and game lawn offers volleyball, a croquet field, horseshoes, a badminton court and bocce. The hotel also offers babysitting services upon request.', 'Accessibility:\n While a shuttle service is provided to get between the resort and the Aviara Golf Club and tennis facilities, it’s worth noting that this hotel is expansive and might not be suitable for travelers with limited mobility. ADA rooms are available on the ground floor along with elevator and wheelchair access ramps.', 'Anything left to mention?\n One important note: while this hotel does provide wonderful views of the ocean in the distance and a “beach-like” atmosphere, Aviara should not be considered a beach resort. The hotel is set a few miles inland from the beach in a quiet residential neighborhood and guests who book here come for the expansive on-site amenities and activities. If you’re looking for something in the heart of the action or for more of a walkability-factor you might want to look elsewhere.']","7100 Aviara Resort Dr., Carlsbad, California 92011, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/carlsbad/carlsbadpark-hyatt-aviara-resort,http://parkaviara.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html

The 162-room Marriott Tribute Portfolio property retained some historic details, like the (restored) exterior and grand stone staircase. But there are plenty of the new touches, too, like blush-colored velvet couches, herringbone floors, and a slick lobby bar."", ""What's the backstory?\nA growing number of military bases in 1920s San Diego created the need for a community center for service men and women. This Army-Navy YMCA was registered as a National Historic Place in 2007."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nSix room categories range from the 200-square-foot Apprentice to the nearly 450-square-foot Master suites. (There's also a two-bedroom penthouse.) The rooms may be small, but the ceilings are high, and the design team kept almost everything white with minimal decor. A subway-tiled bathroom has Maison Margiela products, and all rooms come with in-room safes, Netflix- and Hulu-equipped Smart TVs, and a custom artwork paired with a short biography on the artist."", ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nWith its striped parasols and Palm Springs–meets–French Riviera vibe, the outdoor courtyard at Luca, the all-day Mediterranean restaurant at The Guild, draws locals and guests alike. The menu offers omelettes, avocado toast, and cardamom lattes for breakfast; sandwiches and salads for lunch; and small plates like Spanish octopus and roasted red peppers with fig jam and pistachio dust for dinner. Don't miss a cocktail or local beer at The Guild Bar in the lobby, which has indoor and outdoor seating. Rich in velvet and jewel tones, it's a welcome respite from the beachy, tropical interior design so common in this town."", ""And the service?\nBefriend Carley, the front desk supervisor; she's an ace at making you feel at home and organizing whatever you need."", 'What type of travelers will you find here?\nBusiness travelers during the week, locals at the bar and restaurant, and leisure travelers on weekends and holidays. The crowd here appreciates design-driven hotels, good food, and the comforts of an established hotel brand.', ""What about the neighborhood? What else will we find here?\nDowntown San Diego is many things; there are busy \nrestaurants\n and cool coffee shops among convention centers, office buildings, and sadly, a growing homeless population. That said, The Guild is situated on West Broadway, the more polished section of the pedestrian-friendly neighborhood. It's also a quick walk to the Santa Fe Depot, where trains can zip you up to Old Town, Solana Beach, Oceanside, and downtown \nLos Angeles\n."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\nHotel designer Sormeh Rienne restored and framed one of the building’s original blueprints, unearthed in a wall during construction; today it hangs in the lobby. The 24-hour gym is equipped with Peloton bikes; you can also take classes, use the rooftop pool at Broadway Athletic and Swim Club; and there are donation-based yoga classes the first Sunday of each month.', 'Bottom line: What are we coming here for?\nCome for the chic design, good food, and affable service in a convenient downtown location.']","500 W.

The furniture is more traditional than trendy—think beige walls, wood accents, and leather reading chairs.', 'How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies.

The menu, from the Inn’s Veranda Fireside Lounge & Restaurant, is simple (buttermilk pancakes, fish tacos, burgers) but tasty.', 'How did you find the staff?\nOverall the staff is friendly and helpful in accommodating specific needs.', ""Any other cool features we didn't ask about yet?\nMake time for the excellent spa, which has special outdoor treatment rooms in a garden setting, plus a private pool. If getting pampered isn’t your thing, the 18-hole Championship golf course is popular and has hosted PGA and LPGA events."", ""What was most memorable about your stay?\nYou'll feel completely secluded from the outside world, transported to a place where airplane noise and traffic are swapped with stillness and fresh air.

It feels a little like a palace in Spain or France —with California burritos and great surf just a few miles away. It's an antidote to anyone tired of overly slick, minimalist hotels geared toward millennials."", ""What's the backstory?\nInspired by the architecture of Addison Mizner, best known for his 1920s-era designs of mansions in Palm Beach, Calif., and Boca Raton, Fla., the design of Fairmont Grand Del Mar combines opulence with a laid-back SoCal feel."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\nThe 249 rooms are divided into 500-square-foot guest rooms, 1,000-square-foot suites, and 5,000-square-foot villas.

Rooms and suites come with views of the well-manicured grounds or the pool; the two-story villas have private outdoor patios overlooking the golf course.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\nThe $45 resort fee includes Wi-Fi. You can bump up to faster speeds for $10, but the standard should do just fine.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\nAddison\n, the onsite contemporary French restaurant run by chef and director William Bradley, received San Diego's first Michelin star. Here, you choose from a five-course ($165 per person) or 10-course ($265 per person) meal and enjoy it with some of the best service you'll ever find at a restaurant. There's also the less formal (but still elegant) Amaya, casual fare at The Clubhouse Grill, poolside snacks, and Grand Afternoon Tea, complete with finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, in the Library. And the High-end meals are great, but we also love the chocolate-covered Oreos at turndown."", ""And the service?\nYou get what you pay for here, which means first-class service from check-in to room service to the restaurants. Staffers can arrange transportation, set up beach gear, book tickets, and everything in between. They've also coordinated many a marriage proposal; they once lent an albino horse from the equestrian center for a unicorn-themed proposal, and arranged an In-N-Out dinner by the beach—complete with Manhattan cocktails—for a couple celebrating an anniversary."", ""What type of travelers will you find here?\nIt's mostly adults, but a broad age range from 30-something couples to retirees. You'll see the occasional family with young kids, but it's likely they'll stick to the main resort pool while those without kids enjoy the peace and quiet (and cocktails) at the adults' only Relaxation Pool."", ""What about the neighborhood? What will we find here?\nDespite its name, the resort is actually located in the upscale enclave of Carmel Valley, five miles from the Pacific. In most ways this feels like paradise, but you won't be able to walk to shops or restaurants other than the ones on the property. If you want to go to the beach—this is San Diego, after all—the hotel can provide roundtrip transportation to and from Del Mar's 18th Street beach, which has beach chairs, umbrellas, towels, and bottled water."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\nHit the hotel's equestrian center for trail rides through nearby Los Peñasquitos Canyon; join guided hikes on Saturday mornings; play on their bougie tennis court where you can get private lessons from an NCAA doubles champ and former touring pro; and send your littles to the Explorer's Club ($50-90 per child, includes meals), where they can paint, play Ping Pong, watch movies, and more."", 'Bottom line: Worth it?\nYes; the rooms, service, and amenities justify the high price tag.']","5300 Grand Del Mar Ct., San Diego, California 92130, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/san-diego/grand-del-mar-san-diego,https://www.fairmont.com/san-diego/

The restaurant, Nari, from Pim Techamuanvivit (of Kin Khao) serves upscale and spicy Thai dishes.

In the lobby, potted plants and succulents mingle with geometric cane-back chairs and brightly patterned throw pillows. Open wood and metal pipe shelving holds a collection of books and art objects, and patterned rugs cover light wood floors. The hotel isn't opulent, but it is a cool brand of cozy, and the kind of place you go and wonder how you could up the design in your own living room. Open, 19-foot ceilings, rustic Douglas fir beams, and pendant lights lend just a bit of an industrial vibe."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nFamilies; Japanese culture enthusiasts.', ""The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThere's nothing sterile about the rooms at the Hotel Kabuki. Dramatic, dark gray walls are hung with traditional and modern Japanese art and calligraphy that's far more interesting than your typical hotel painting of Alcatraz. Pops of color in the artwork and on the headboards brighten things up, and the furniture is Scandinavian-inspired."", ""Thanks to oversized windows, there's plenty of natural light, and many rooms have balconies. These are comfortable, well-decorated spaces, but some are pretty tiny; the smallest rooms at the hotel clock in at 215 square feet."", ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep.

It would be great for special occasions and staycations.","[""How did it strike you on arrival?\nPure charm. The hotel is in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood, on a hillside tucked between mansions. Walking up the stone steps into the wood-paneled lobby feels like walking into a charming country inn—in the middle of San Francisco. It has a far more intimate vibe than so many hotels in the city, and it's clear they're paying attention to the details—inlaid wooden floors, chocolate cookies in the shape of the hotel logo, and even real metal keys tucked in cubbies behind the carved front desk."", ""What’s the crowd like?\nAt the hotel's complimentary breakfast, you'll see couples in athleisure wear and business men in suits. Guests skew a bit older, and the Drisco often hosts guests celebrating big occasions, like birthdays and anniversaries. Mention that's what you're here for, and they'll give you a bottle of wine to celebrate. About 80 percent of their guests come from the United States."", 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.\nThe rooms are done in cream and white, from the patterned carpet to the drapes and the bedding. The hotel is serious about environmental issues, so each room contains a Brita pitcher and glass Hotel Drisco water bottles that guests are invited to take with them when they leave. They also feature Nespresso coffee machines, Ikaati tea, and a pillow menu.', ""We’re craving some deep, restorative sleep. They got us?\nThe beds are king-sized, with pillow top mattresses. Request turn-down service, and you’ll return to find a white-noise machine and a chocolate shortbread cookie stamped with the hotel logo. In-room sound machines ensure that guests can get a good night's sleep despite noise from the street or other guests. (As I was hanging around in the sitting room, a guest asked if she could purchase the sheets, she liked them so much)."", ""How about the little things, like mini bar, or shower goodies?\nThe complimentary breakfast is a beautiful spread, with tiny, raspberry-topped fruit and yogurt parfaits, hot oatmeal, bagels and lox, wee jars of clotted cream, and trendy extras like celery juice and organic protein shots. The Drisco has done away with its mini-bars, because they weren't used much, but it does have 24-hour room service, and full place settings of china in room. There is also complimentary wine, and cold and hot hors d'oeuvres in the evenings."", 'Please tell us the bathroom won’t let us down.\nAt the Hotel Drisco, bathrooms are spacious and opulent, with white marble showers and black marble counters. Each room comes with robes and a pair of slippers, the bathroom products are by Bvlgari, and they even include Poo-Pourri, the, uh, ""spritz the bowl before you go and no one will ever know"" product. Bathroom floors are heated.', ""Maybe the most important topic of all: Wi-Fi. What’s the word?\nWi-Fi is strong enough for you to stream movies from your room, and it's complimentary. The hotel also has Blu-ray players in each room, and a collection of discs for guests to borrow. Eventually, they will phase Blu-ray out for digital options, but families enjoy the convenience."", ""Room service: Worth it?\nSoups and salads, like the big hearty salad with Humboldt Fog goat cheese and strawberries ($12) and grilled chicken panini ($12), are made fresh, while entrees like braised beef short ribs ($22) are made sous-vide by a chef in Sonoma, and heated by the staff at the hotel. Prices are very reasonable for food in San Francisco, where a takeout salad can run over $15. The best news of all is that it's 24 hours."", 'Staff: If you could award one a trophy, who gets it, and why?\nThe complimentary breakfast is a buffet, but hotel staff takes coffee orders. One made me a fantastic latte.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features? Whether it’s childcare, gyms, spas, even parking—whatever stuck with you.\nThe hotel has a small gym with a Peloton, yoga mats, and TRX mount, but guests also can get complimentary passes to the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco or check out one of their complimentary bikes.', 'What was most memorable—or heartbreaking—about your stay?\nThe staff—and the manager, John Spear—care a lot about details. After their Christmas decorator moved out of state, the hotel decided they loved his work so much that they would fly him in to decorate for the holidays.', ""Bottom line: worth it, and why?\nIf you want a big downtown hotel experience, this isn't it.

The place completed the renovation in 2022, so everything is crisp, gorgeous, and gleaming new."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n I stayed in the Golden Gate-View Corner Suite. From the moment I walked in, I couldn’t stop staring outside. The massive windows frame sweeping city views, from Sutro Tower to the \nGolden Gate Bridge\n. Transamerica Pyramid looks almost close enough to touch; Coit Tower glows faintly in the distance. Inside, the room pays homage to San Francisco, with a gray-and-eggshell palette, clean-lined midcentury furnishings, and a hand-tufted rug that echoes the colors outside. The soaking tub is perfectly positioned to take in the glittering city lights, and thoughtful tech touches—like a smartphone charging pad and a thermostat that tells the temperature indoors and out—make life easier. Plus, newly released in 2022, the Golden Gate Terrace Suite and the Embarcadero Terrace Suite boast an expansive 2,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor living space and some of San Francisco’s largest private terraces.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n The hotel offers standard Wi-Fi for free, and premium WiFi for $21.95 daily.

In the meantime, Chef Michael Bega, of Four Seasons Silicon Valley, is pinch-hitting, with great success.

The must-order: chocolate mousse, perfectly whipped, topped with a thin layer of caramel.', 'And the service?\n As you’d expect of a Four Seasons, the service is white-glove.

They're discreet and enjoy the finer things in life."", 'What about the neighborhood? What else is nearby?\n The hotel is in the thick of FiDi, a short walk from the \nFerry Building\n, Chinatown, and North Beach. It’s a convenient neighborhood for daytime touristing (or weekday business meetings), but it’s pretty sleepy at night.', 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The Skybridge—the glassed-in midsection of the upper floors—grants views even more jaw-dropping than the ones in the guest rooms. On the 48th floor, you can play “Eye Spy” and try to and identify ten landmarks outside. Want pointers on capturing it all?

The space, like the club, unfolds itself slowly.', ""What's the backstory?\n The Battery’s founders, Michael and Xochi Birch, met at a London club; years later—fresh off the $850 million sale of their tech startup—they wanted to create a space in San Francisco with a similar vibe: elegant yet convivial, the kind of place where you might bump into a stranger and wind up chatting for hours. They hired superstar designer Ken Fulk to make it happen. The result is a marvel: Massive gold chain mail chandeliers light a bar arrayed with ships’ mastheads and Cousteau-ian accessories, while a great glass elevator (hand-built in Finland, disassembled, and painstakingly erected here) whisks guests to higher floors. The club has been collecting art since its inception, and those pieces—which range from provocative photography to vivid-hued oils—are throughout the building."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations.

The India-based company runs properties worldwide, but they’re probably best known for taking over centuries-old palaces and operating them as luxury resorts. This property, too, has a past. The hotel is made up of two historic buildings, erected in 1909 and 1910, joined by an atrium. Given this history, the rooms differ in size, layout, and design.

I would definitely eat at the restaurant even if I weren’t staying at the Taj.', 'And the service?\n I felt well taken care of, from check-in to check-out. The front desk staff was unfailingly helpful. Case in point: When I called down because I was having trouble with a bike on the fitness terrace, the clerk immediately sent an engineer to fix it. The bartender David, in particular, anticipated my every need, and truly went above and beyond.

Guess which crew hangs in the bar.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n Just a block off Union Square, the Taj feels like a quiet world away. Still, its bar and restaurant draw locals… and travelers staying at nearby hotels. The rotating lobby art comes from the nearby Meyerovich Gallery, on Post Street. Other neighbors include Gucci, Valentino, and Hermès, all just steps away. At 110 rooms, this is a boutique property, but it’s as luxurious as SF’s other four-star hotels. I’d recommend the Taj for anyone who’s looking for great amenities and a high level of personal attention.', 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n Perched atop the ninth floor and sheltered by a high tent, the open-air fitness terrace is a can’t-miss, particularly on warm days, when the front of the tent is raised, revealing a bird’s-eye view of Union Square! I also love the “as you wish” quality to the place—the fact that, as a guest, you can request a room with the bathroom configuration, furniture, and location of your choice.', 'Bottom line: Worth it?

Give us the wide-angle view.\nWalking up to the Proper at 5 o'clock on a Friday night, there was an hour-long wait down the block to get into Charmaine's, the hotel's hip, swanky rooftop bar—who could resist firepits and views of the city skyline? The high-end hotel opened in November of 2017 to much fanfare; a month later, it was still tough to find a seat for a drink in the lobby, which is decked out in the artsy-cool stylings of designer Kelly Wearstler. Pattern and color reign supreme at the Proper, with bright florals on furniture, rugs, and pillows, mixing with mirrors, eclectic groupings of paintings running up and down the walls, and graphic black and white prints. It's a lot, but it's fun—and a serious shift from the neutral tones that run rampant in San Francisco's other hotels."", 'What’s the crowd like?\nThe Proper is the height of cool; on a Friday night, you can see cocktail dresses and blazers, leather and boots. When LCD Soundsystem performed in San Francisco, the band stayed there.', 'The good stuff: Tell us about your room.', ""Here's something you don't see at a lot of hotels: a bunk room, albeit way fancier than the one you had as a kid. At The Proper, these walnut double-deckers have built-in brass ladders, outlets, USB ports, and TVs with built-in headphones. If ladders to beds aren't your jam, don't fret. The Proper also has plenty of regular rooms, both standard size and junior and premier suites."", ""Regardless of the size you choose, Wearstler's fizzy aesthetic carries into the rooms, with graphic and floral wallpaper—sometimes on adjoining walls—geometric lamps and tables, and patterned throw rugs on wood floors. The hotel was also able to preserve the original windows of the 19064 flatiron building."", ""How's the bed situation? Did you get a good night's sleep?\nGuests in beds of all sizes sleep in California Aireloom king mattresses tucked in crisp Italian Bellino Fine Linens, topped with down comforters and striped Kelly Wearstler cotton blankets; the comfort factor is dialed way up."", ""And the amenities? Anything you desperately wanted to sneak back with you?\nSo much. Oblong marble coffee tables, tablets in every room, Bluetooth speakers, and Google Chromecast for streaming. Even the bunk rooms have rainshowers. All bathrooms are stocked with Aesop beauty products, Bellino Fine Linens towels, and Kelly Wearstler cotton kimono robes. I'd take one of everything, given the choice."", 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nThe property has a complimentary car service for guests, that will take you anywhere in a 3-mile radius–but get in line early, as it’s first-come, first-serve.', ""Bottom line: would you stay here again, and why?\nThe location is going to be a turn-off for a lot of travelers, but it's very swanky and hip; it's also convenient for business travelers who need to run off to meetings in the Mid-Market neighborhood.""]","1100 Market St., San Francisco, California 94102, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/san-francisco/proper-hotel-san-francisco,https://www.properhotel.com/hotels/san-francisco/
Westin St. Francis San Francisco on Union Square,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"If you’re looking for a stunning property with a fascinating history, the St. Francis is a good bet. In the early 1900s, the family of railroad magnate Charles Crocker dreamed of transforming San Francisco into “the Paris of the West,” constructing the St. Francis as a sort of centerpiece. The hotel, remarkably, survived the 1906 earthquake, and quickly became a magnet for the glitterati. The parade of people who have passed through the hotel reads like a who’s who of…everyone. Louis Armstrong played here, Shirley Temple posed here, Ernest Hemingway drank here, Emperor Hirohito slept here. Perhaps no hotel is more intricately interwoven into Bay Area life than the St. Francis. Locals know the St. Francis for its opulent holiday display in the lobby, centered on a massive, intricate sugar castle.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention? What's the vibe?\n Looking up from ground level, the Westin St. Francis feels almost too big to fathom. Towering 31 stories above Union Square and spanning a city block, this gray stone hotel looks like a European castle that somehow landed in the center of San Francisco. Inside, the lobby follows suit, with soaring ceilings, cream-and-black marble flooring, and huge glittering chandeliers."", ""What's the backstory?\n In the early 1900s, the family of railroad magnate Charles Crocker dreamed of transforming San Francisco into “the Paris of the West,” constructing the St. Francis as a sort of centerpiece. The hotel, remarkably, survived the 1906 earthquake, and quickly became a magnet for the glitterati. The parade of people who have passed through the hotel reads like a who’s who of…everyone. Louis Armstrong played here, Shirley Temple posed here, Ernest Hemingway drank here, Emperor Hirohito slept here. Perhaps most famously, in 1983, following a state dinner, Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip retired to the hotel’s Windsor Suite, while President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan stayed in the London Suite."", ""Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n The St. Francis has a whopping 1,196 rooms, split between the hotel’s original (Landmark) building and newer (Tower) building. While parts of the property date back over a century, the rooms feel fresh, thanks to renovations in 2018. I stayed in the Bridgeview Suite, one of the hotel’s 81 suites (though it's currently under renovation). Like the St. Francis itself, the room impressed with sheer scale: Just inside the door, it had its own miniature lobby, with marble flooring and a chandelier overhead. Huge windows granted views of all San Francisco, from the downtown skyscrapers to the glittering \nGolden Gate Bridge\n. This room, like all the others on property, features the trademark Westin brand bed, which feels like a cloud. And the rain shower is so soothing, it was hard to get out!"", 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n Wi-Fi is free to Marriott Bonvoy members, and $14.95 per day for everyone else. (FWIW, it is incredibly fast!)', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n At the hotel’s sit-down restaurant, The Oak Room, Chef Fernando Reyes draws on various culinary influences to breathe new life into old standards. To wit, his Dungeness crab cake arrives topped with miso-ginger dressing and Napa cabbage kimchi. Indulge in a nightcap at Clock Bar, which harkens San Francisco in the 1920s and is overseen by Michael Mina. In the lobby, Cafe Rito offers grab-and-go Italian fare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They brew Starbucks coffee.', 'And the service?\n The service depends upon who happens to be on the front desk. Some staff members are knowledgeable, helpful, and anticipatory; others are less so.', 'What type of travelers will you find here?\n Flip-flop wearing tourists laden with shopping bags, Silicon Valley types tapping away on laptops, international travelers toting oversize luggage, airline pilots in uniform. You never know just who’ll you encounter.', 'What about the neighborhood? Does the hotel fit in, make itself part of the scene?\n Perhaps no hotel is more intricately interwoven into Bay Area life than the St. Francis. The hotel caters events all over town, hosts proms for local high schools, and organizes fundraisers for the likes of Guide Dogs for the Blind. But above all, locals know the St. Francis for its opulent holiday display in the lobby, centered on a massive, intricate sugar castle, built by Executive Pastry Chef Jean-François Houdre and his team. Many people make an annual pilgrimage to the hotel to come admire the décor.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\n I would have loved to see more anticipatory service."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n Chateau Montelena—the Calistoga winery whose Chardonnay famously bested its French competitors in the 1976 Judgment of Paris—has a tasting room in the lobby, the only one outside the chateau. Reserve a tasting in advance, and you can have the \nNapa experience\n right here in San Francisco.', 'Riding the elevator in the Tower Building is utterly magical. The glass-walled elevators run up the building’s exterior wall. That means that, at first, you’ll ascend first through darkness, then behind the Landmark Building, and, finally, you’ll clear its roof…and get a breathtaking bird’s-eye panorama of Union Square below.', 'Bottom line: Worth it? Why?\n If you’re looking for a stunning property with a fascinating history, the St. Francis is a good bet.']","335 Powell Street, San Francisco, California 94102, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/san-francisco/westin-st-francis,https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sfouw-the-westin-st-francis-san-francisco-on-union-square

Between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. you can also design your own sandwich ($18), snag a burger ($23), or opt for grilled pacific salmon ($38) or New York steak and frites ($41).

The three-story brick building is lined with long porches dotted with rocking chairs, and it's easy to imagine enjoying an afternoon with a good book, looking over the Presidio, with a view of the very top of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Presidio is a different kind of San Francisco experience, with so much to do, from hiking and running, to the Walt Disney Family Museum, and the Presidio Golf Course, an 18-hole course that winds among the hills of the park. It's an amazing getaway right in the city; locals even stay here.","['How did it strike you on arrival?\nThe location is incredible. Most hotels in the city are concentrated around downtown. The Inn at the Presidio is a small B&B in the \nPresidio\n, a 1,500-acre national park at the foot of the \nGolden Gate Bridge\n.

1 Hotel San Francisco,"Hot List, 2023. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"The unicorn this city has been waiting for, 1 Hotel San Francisco has an excellent location overlooking the Bay, an eco ethos at the core of its brand, on-point design, and a bar/restaurant that takes advantage of the fact that it’s mere feet from one of the country’s best farmers markets. While the lobby and the hallways are on the moody side of lighting, the 186 rooms and 14 suites are bright and sunny. My king room looked out toward the Ferry Building and over the Bay, with the Bay Bridge off in the distance. (For even more insane waterfront views, the panoramic suite—630 square feet with sweeping Bay vistas—is the room to book).—Rebecca Misner","['Why book?\n There is no shortage of hotels in \nSan Francisco\n. But, truth be told, none get high marks across the board. One might have a glorious natural setting, but is a hike from any real restaurant or cultural scene. Another, amazing design, but the location is a total downer. And, of course, there are a handful of high-end, big names that have excellent service and all the luxury bells and whistles, but aren’t exactly pushing boundaries when it comes to sustainability or decor. 1 Hotel San Francisco is the unicorn this city has been waiting for. It has an excellent location overlooking the Bay, an eco ethos at the core of its brand, on-point design, and a bar/restaurant that takes advantage of the fact that it’s mere feet from one of the country’s best farmers markets.', ""Set the scene\n The location could not be better. The hotel is on the corner of Mission Street, which slices diagonally through the city, and the Embarcadero, which hugs the waterfront from the Bay Bridge west to Fisherman’s Wharf. And it’s right across the street from the iconic \nFerry Building\n, which, while still an active ferry terminal, has morphed into foodie paradise with outposts of places like Hog Island Oyster and Gott's Roadside and a thrice-weekly farmers market spoken about by locals with near religious zeal. If you’ve been to any of the other six 1 Hotels around the globe, you will recognize some through lines here. For starters, the design in the public spaces. The first floor, which houses the check in area as well as a spacious, multi-room lobby with lots of reclaimed wood, low-slung leather and upholstered couches and woven chairs clustered around coffee tables; it's low lit with a color palette that doubles down on neutrals—plenty of cream, sand, and gray. Then there’s the 1 Hotel distinct scent—delicious and woodsy without overpowering—and of course the plants; there are potted plants and living walls everywhere. The overall impact of the mellow lighting, the color scheme, the organic design, and natural materials is tremendously soothing. I was visiting on the hotel’s opening day, so the public spaces were not as bustling as they will certainly be in the near future. But this first floor lobby is made for lingering and I can imagine that guests will happily meet up here before dinner or park it here for an hour and crank out work emails. The guests that I do see are smartly dressed, hip but casual. Maybe on the creative side of tech. And the overall vibe–from guests and staff–is joyful; people are thrilled to be out and about, traveling and working again."", 'The backstory\n The 1 Hotel has taken over what was formerly the Hotel Vitale, which always had fabulous bones (lots of windows, spacious guest rooms) but had been feeling a little frayed for the last few years of its existence. 1 Hotel San Francisco is the brand’s seventh property and its second in California (the West Hollywood outpost opened in 2019). 1 Hotels is known for its mission-driven hospitality; for really walking the sustainability walk and showing that luxury and eco-awareness can truly go hand-in-hand.', 'The rooms\n While the lobby and the hallways are on the moody side of lighting, the 186 rooms and 14 suites, are bright and sunny. My king room looked out toward the Ferry Building and over the Bay, with the Bay Bridge off in the distance. (For even more insane waterfront views, the panoramic suite—630 square feet with sweeping Bay vistas—is the room to book). Like the public spaces, my room is a case study in neutrals and naturals: nubby cream throw pillows and a chunky woven blanket on the bed, a leather headboard, reclaimed wood on the walls, and several potted plants. There are thoughtful, lovely touches throughout: a wall-mounted coat rack and a little low table when you enter the room to hang your jacket and toss your purse onto, a hand-painted rock that says “Not Now” that you place on a little shelf outside your door instead of the usual plastic “Do Not Disturb” doorknob tag. And my favorite, a little wooden plaque that explains the brand’s 1 Less Thing program: in short, if you’ve overpacked (or gone shopping and have no space in your suitcase) you simply leave what you can’t fit or don’t need behind with the plaque on top. The hotel, in partnership with a local charity, will get the goods to someone in need. Rates from $355 per night.', 'Food and drink\n One of the best things about San Francisco is its access to amazing produce and proximity to ethically-run ranches and dairies. Just about everything grows and thrives in this NorCal climate, and the hotel’s bar and restaurant Terrene leans into this. The dinner menu spotlights the local bounty and skews Mediterranean with standouts such as the laffa (a chewier pita) with baba ganoush or a spicy carrot harissa dip and lamb sliders with mango jam and shallot pickle. And the cocktail menu is just as considered and full of insanely creative drinks, like the gin based, citrus-heavy Tiny Sea Monster, and the Napa Dreaming—which, with a Cabernet float, might be the most beautiful cocktail I’ve ever had. The breakfast menu is solid, with great coffee, a strong smoothie list, and things like overnight oats and an elevated take on an egg and cheese. The restaurant and bar are open to hotel guests and walk-ins for now, but it will begin taking reservations later this summer. Bonus—there’s a large, water-facing outdoor patio that will open soon.', 'The spa\n It wasn’t open when I visited, but when the spa does arrive, it will be a treasure located on the top floor, with three treatment rooms (one double room) and views of the water and the city. The real treat though, is the patio area off of the spa that has two huge outdoor soaking tubs (surrounded by privacy screens). It will be an experience to soak in a rooftop tub after a massage and look out at the skyline. The hotel also has a gym with Peloton bikes, treadmills, and weights.', 'The neighborhood/area\n As mentioned, the location is excellent. In addition to being on the water and across the street from the Ferry Building, the Embarcadero walking path and the beloved restaurant Boulevard (newly renovated by designer Ken Fulk), the hotel is about a 15-minute stroll from so many highlights, like Mister Jiu’s restaurant in Chinatown, SFMOMA in the SoMa district, \nCity Lights\n bookstore in North Beach, and Coit Tower in Telegraph Hill. Most everything else you’d want to check out during a visit—Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, Ocean Beach—is an easy 25-minute car ride. (The hotel has a house car that will drop you within a certain radius, as well as an Audi e-tron that guests can take out for a test drive.)', 'The service\n High-level but casual. The staff is friendly and helpful but not overly formal.', 'For families\n It’s not designed for families, per se—even though it has a casual, low fuss energy, it’s still a sophisticated hotel in terms of vibe and design—but families would be comfortable here. There are a number of connecting rooms that combine a king room with a two-queen room, which would be ideal for a family with (non-toddler) kids.', ""Eco effort\n It would be easier to say what isn’t part of the hotel's eco effort than to list what is. Nearly every aspect of the guest experience (to say nothing of the back of the house) has an eco component. Materials are ethically sourced and natural, from the repurposed wood (much of the redwood that you see was salvaged from historic barns and industrial buildings and, even cooler, from the original Bay Bridge) to the hand-loomed wool rugs. There are water filling stations on every floor, and water bottles and glass carafes in every room. There’s no plastic packaging in any of the minibar offerings (and many are from local Bay Area companies like chocolate from 9th and Larkin and granola bars from Nana Joes). The hotel even has a rooftop beehive as well as a garden where it grows many of the herbs and some of the produce used in the restaurant. Zero waste is taken seriously, to the point where a single cocktail may use the juice of the lemon, a dehydrated lemon rind, as well as a glass-rimming ash made from leftover dehydrated rinds. The hotel car is electric. Room keys are made from wood…and I could keep going. All to say, the hotel’s eco effort is strong and brand defining."", 'Accessibility\n ADA standards are met and there are elevators and ramps in place.']","8 Mission St, San Francisco, California 94105",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/san-francisco/1-hotel-san-francisco,https://www.1hotels.com/san-francisco

The building is new construction but manages to feel like it’s been around for quite some time. A real effort has been made to connect with Savannah’s culture and style, with input from local artisans.', 'What can we expect from our room?\nA touch retro, yet crisp, clear, and uncluttered. Compared to rooms in the main building, those in the tower feel more spacious and private. All have metal-framed artwork, Turkish rugs, and leather chairs. There’s a rain shower but no tub, and a fluffy, sink-into-it bed next to a corner sofa.', ""What about the food and drink?\nThe ground-floor Emporium has a sit-down restaurant with an open kitchen plating up modern French bistro food but with Southern nods where appropriate—pimento cheese omelette, smoked fish rillettes. But it also throws a wine shop and wine bar in the mix, along with a deli and gelato stand, coffee bar, and even a mini-market.

Leaning into its history, Kessler has outfitted the hotel with installations that channel the Jurassic period, including life size dinosaur skeletons and fossils, backlit in a range of bright colors, displayed throughout the walls. It could all feel a little extreme for a hotel, but given the ginormous space (high ceilings made of glass, which makes the space feel even more open), it kind of works."", ""How are the rooms?\nI had a two-level suite with gorgeous river views.

This collection of restaurants is designed to bring in locals and help revive the already emerging riverfront as a place to be in the city. The barbecue was excellent, especially the chicken. Due to COVID-19 we ordered and ate in the room, but you can in theory eat it at the outdoor brewhouse."", ""In summer, I can see it being a hot spot, with sports on, loads of beers on tap, and river views. Even early in the morning, the cafe had locals in doing breakfast meetings. Their menu was exactly what you want when you wake up late, including egg sandwiches and healthful bowls. I didn't make it up, but the rooftop will likely be a hit in warmer months for its river and city views."", ""Tell us about the spa, gym, and gift shop. Any other hotel features worth noting?\nThere is a spa and a gym that I avoided due to COVID. They were on the smaller side but seemed to do the trick. The gift store had a smart selection of artisan products from around the world; at my stay they had baskets from African weavers as well as children's toys and books."", 'What about the neighborhood?\nThe hotel is the most ambitious project on the riverfront, which had been a sketchy area on the fringe of downtown Savannah but is now coming back to life with bars, restaurants, and gift shops. It seems like a nice slice of the city, if a little touristy (hence the gift shops). But it really does not matter too much as the city is a short walk away. In fact, it is kind of nice to wake up along the river, where you can take walks or go for a jog to start your day.', 'How is the service?\nService was nice, a good blend of corporate efficiency and southern hospitality.

The direct area lacks the bustle of restaurant-goers in the evenings or ambience that encourages a casual stroll, but the convenient freeway access right Downtown makes it easy to get to almost anywhere by car or public transport.

But the Toronto-based luxury brand is familiar to travelers north-of-the-border, and it’s not unusual to see fleece-clad Canadian couples scooting baby strollers across the Fairmont’s plush carpets.', 'The good stuff: Tell us what we need to know about the rooms.\nIn 2015, the Fairmont spruced things up with a $25 million renovation. While the lobby still exudes an old-school chintzy charm, the crisp, neutral palette in its 450 guest rooms inspire instant relaxation. Marble countertops and rain showers keep things luxurious in the bathrooms, while super-soft down pillows and duvets reinforce the fairy-tale feel of the place. It’s almost enough to make you forgive the Wi-Fi fee. (The service is free for Fairmont President’s Club members.)', 'Room service: Worth it?\nOkay, yes—this is the sort of over-the-top hotel where you want to indulge in some serious room-service action. The Fairmont treats guests to an extensive all-hours menu, meaning you can order huckleberry cheesecake or a kobe beef hot dog at any hour.', 'How did you find staff?\nWith a discerning clientele that can be downright demanding, the friendly front desk staff display the sort of courtly etiquette befitting the palatial surroundings.', 'Anything stand out about other services and features?\nGet your laps in and soak up some sun at the same time—enclosed in a glass “solarium,” the indoor pool is kept to a toasty 83 degrees. Valet parking will run you $55 per night, a little on the steep side but that lines up with the rest of the hotel? Street parking is nonexistent in this section of the city. With on-trend strength-training equipment—medicine balls, Kinesis Technogym equipment—alongside cardio stalwarts, the fitness center is easy to use and more cheerful than most.', 'Bottom line: Why should we stay here?\nA stay at the Fairmont Olympic will time-warp you to an era when luxury and maximalism went hand-in-hand. Built in the 1920s and undergoing an enormous $25 million dollar restoration from 2020-2021, this massive Italian Renaissance hotel is breathtakingly opulent. Tufted sofas, ornate chandeliers, and historic marble flooring lend Versailles-level glitz in the lobby, and the grand staircases are the stuff of Disney princess movies before guests even get to any of the 450 rooms.']","411 University St., Seattle, Washington 98101, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/seattle/fairmont-olympic-hotel-seattle,http://www.fairmont.com/seattle/

1 Hotel Toronto,"Hot List, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Located in what was previously the Thompson Hotel, the 1 Hotel marks a new chapter in Canadian hospitality. This brand’s biophilic design and green-minded ethos is a natural fit for Toronto, a lakefront city filled with parks and forests—just look at the exterior rock garden lined with indigenous greenery, or the massive living wall hanging over the lobby bar. Although this hotel occupies a plum location just steps from all the bars and restaurants of King Street West, it feels like a natural escape where visitors can come, enjoy the rooftop pool, and feel like they’re on a staycation anywhere but the heart of one of North America’s most vibrant metropolises.","['Why book?', 'The hotels in Canada’s biggest city tend to skew either unremittingly corporate or standard bohemian-chic. This lush new exception—a literal urban oasis that takes sustainability seriously—is distinguished by its biophilic design, impressive conservation programs, and real community mindedness. Rest assured, though, that the luxury factor hasn’t been compromised. While the in-room tumblers and carafes may be made from reclaimed wine bottles, that’s still Veuve Clicquot Champagne and small-batch Dillon’s gin in the impeccably stocked minibars. And did we mention the rooftop swimming pool boasting waterside service and breathtaking views of the downtown skyline?', 'Set the scene', 'Located where a Thompson Hotel once operated, 1 Hotel Toronto couldn’t be more distinct aesthetically from its retro-modern forebear. Although the basic footprint remains the same, an elaborate rock garden dotted with indigenous trees and shrubs now lines the Wellington Street West exterior, while a formerly underused pavilion in the courtyard just to the east of the building houses a seasonal herb and vegetable garden and a buzzing bee hotel. Inside, the cavernous reception area has been outfitted with floorboards and shelving made of elm salvaged from a dismantled barn in rural Ontario; the space is punctuated at one end by a massive “living” wall installation overlooking the welcoming lobby bar (the vegetal piece’s creator, floral designer Lauren Wilson of local studio Timberlost, replenishes the greenery as needed). And though 1 Hotel sits mere steps from \nToronto\n’s often boisterous King Street West nightlife, it seems to be attracting more than just the district’s cool kids. During a recent Tuesday-morning visit, two sunbathers dangled their legs in the outdoor roof pool, while a staycationing couple and their little son splashed in the water nearby.', 'The backstory', 'Having launched in 2015 with the goal of melding luxury hospitality with minimal environmental impact, 1 Hotels currently operates eco-chic escapes from South Beach to West Hollywood. For its inaugural property north of the U.S. border, the brand settled on Toronto, a city rife with parks and forests, for its obvious cultural fit. And indeed, the company, which enlisted New York’s Rockwell Group to spearhead the design, found a wealth of like-minded local collaborators ideal for realizing its vision. Just Be Woodsy, a studio that specializes in turning Toronto’s felled trees into usable objects of beauty, crafted many of the furnishings that dot the property, from the monolithic signpost outside the front entrance to the end tables in the rooms. Complementing Timberlost’s wall art in the lobby bar is a giant paper installation that hangs behind the reception desk; mimicking loon feathers, it was created by the internationally acclaimed Toronto studio Moss & Lam. And the stylish staff uniforms, which were designed by sustainable-fashion star \nMisha Nonoo\n? They’re manufactured by locally based Kloth Studio, a bespoke-uniform maker that embraces zero-waste production.', 'The rooms', 'As befits a nature-inspired retreat, the hotel’s 91 guest rooms and 21 suites are oases of calm and well-being. The noisy city outside is barely discernible through the floor-to-ceiling windows, which allow natural light to flood in when the drapes are drawn. A soothing color palette of milky whites, oaty beiges, soft pinks, and pearly blue-grays informs an array of textiles, including organic-cotton bed linens, nubby throw pillows, and fluidly shaped rugs. In entryways, hooks sprouting from wall-mounted pieces of driftwood prove handy for hanging hats and face masks, while cubbies and closets contain slippers tied with raffia, natural-cotton bathrobes, and rolled up yoga mats (a more strenuous workout can be had in the well-equipped basement-level gym, called the Field House). The hotel’s brand of eco-opulence is perhaps best embodied in the bathrooms, where filtered water flows through the chunky black-metal taps and shower heads, biodegradable facial tissues share counter space with Bamford bath products, and deep soaker tubs (some of which look into bedrooms through shuttered openings) feature rustic reclaimed-wood planks across their tops for resting your elbows while reading.', 'Food and drink', 'The hotel recently unveiled Casa Madera, an “immersive” restaurant and live-music venue offering coastal Mexican and Mediterranean fare; it’s California-based Madera Group’s first location in Canada. Also new is Harriet’s Toronto, located next to the pool area on the hotel’s roof; it serves small plates and cocktails against that dramatic sky-high backdrop. Elsewhere, hungry visitors can chow down at the hotel’s signature eatery, 1 Kitchen, which boasts a produce-led menu fueled by its direct relationships with Canadian food purveyors. Of course, all of these venues have access to the organic crops grown on-site in the garden pavilion, from onions and peppers to herbs and edible flowers; those hardworking pollinators in the bee hotel also supply fresh honey.', 'Eco effort', 'As you’d expect from the Canadian flagship of such an eco-focused brand, 1 Hotel Toronto’s sustainability efforts extend well beyond its materials palette and exuberant use of greenery. Many of its more substantive features are invisible to guests. On-site composting, for instance, turns all organic wet waste into reusable soil for the more than 3,300 plants in the hotel and garden. A partnership with Toronto-based Green For Life, meanwhile, ensures the recycling of all paper, plastic, glass, and hazardous waste on the property, while an alliance with GreenPlanet converts 100 percent of kitchen oil and grease into biofuel.', 'The neighborhood/area', 'The hotel’s proximity to King Street West makes it ideal for those seeking access to (as well as respite from) that bustling entertainment strip’s wine bars and nightclubs. Its location on the downtown core’s west side, however, also places it within walking distance of less riotous attractions, including the independent boutiques and restaurants of trendy Queen Street West to the north and the bike trails, parks and cultural venues of the Lake Ontario waterfront to the south.', 'The service', 'Service in Toronto can be hit or miss, but 1 Hotel’s staff is delightfully solicitous when needed, unobtrusive when not. Think wait people who appear at your side almost as soon as you sit down in the busy lobby lounge, then retreat until desired again. The pool attendant during a recent visit was especially intuitive, offering towels and drinks on cue. And the mixologists throughout the site are as friendly as they are creative.', 'Accessibility', 'All public and private spaces are fully accessible, although features do vary by guest room, so those with special needs or requests should make them known at time of booking.']","550 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5V 2V5, Canada",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/toronto/1-hotel-toronto,https://www.1hotels.com/toronto
Ace Hotel Toronto,"Hot List, 2023.",2,"Location is everything, they say, and this Ace has got a killer one, at the intersection of Queen Street West, Chinatown, and King West. The hotel’s restaurant Alder is one of the city’s best, offering excellent people watching of cosmopolitan visitors and stylish Torontonians alike. The funky rooms are outfitted with tons of charming and just plain cool Canadian touches, such as Douglas fir cabinetry, quilts by Canadian artist Kyle Parent, turntables stacked with Canadian vinyl albums curated by a nearby record store, and minibars with local potables like Ontario-based Beattie’s Distillers. If you’re looking for hip, happening and walkable snapshot of all the best that this city has to offer, this is where you’ll want to stay.","['Why book?\n\xa0This 123-room hotel—the Ace chain’s first in the Great White North—sits at the crossroads of three of \nToronto\n’s most happening ’hoods: Queen Street West and Chinatown to the north and northwest, the nightspot-heavy King West strip to the south. Anything that a discerning visitor could want—scene-y wine bars, cutting-edge art galleries, world-caliber dim sum—is only a few minutes away by foot.', 'Set the scene\n\xa0Ace Hotels have often attracted a certain type of alternative traveler more interested in exploring scenes (music, food, art) than visiting tourist sights, not to mention local creatives who tend to appropriate their lobbies as work and entertainment hubs. Toronto’s is no exception. Seen jostling for seats in the soaring lobby lounge on a recent Friday morning were a revered Canadian chef and his wife, various PR mavens holding court with journalists and clients, and the usual brigade of young downtowners tapping away on their laptops. Architect Brigitte Shim, one half of the husband-and-wife team who designed the hotel from top to bottom, describes the lobby as an “urban living room,” intended to welcome guests from around the world and around the corner. And indeed, to spend a few hours in the space, with its revolving door to the street outside and rows of oversized picture windows, is to recall the bustling ground floor in\xa0\nGrand Hotel\n, but with toque-wearing hipsters filling the stage instead of Greta Garbo.', 'The backstory\n\xa0For its Canadian debut, Ace opted to build a brand-new structure on a tight corner lot in Toronto’s historic Garment District, where local textiles and fashion lines were long ago produced. The 14-story result, designed by the prestigious Canadian architecture firm Shim-Sutcliffe, looks a lot like the elegant warehouses and other heritage buildings that still dot the area (and which Ace often repurposes), but is very much a modern building created for pleasure and rest. Those beautiful red bricks that define the exterior? They appear to have been artisanally made but were actually pre-cast. Similarly, the monumental concrete arches that line the hotel’s lower levels and in fact hold up the place are structural as well as stunning. There is no parking garage at the Ace Toronto, in keeping with the brand’s very urban ethos. And that’s okay, as the hotel has been situated in an eminently walkable part of the city.', 'The rooms\n\xa0For a building with such a relatively small footprint, Ace Hotel Toronto packs much into its variously sized rooms and suites, all of which meld the brand’s minimalist aesthetic with distinctly Canadian touches. Among the latter are Douglas fir cabinetry and flooring, custom quilts designed by Canuck artist Kyle Parent, and signature Ace guitars and turntables alongside Canadian vinyl albums curated by Toronto record label Arts & Crafts. In the mini-bars, offerings include such only-in-Canada tipples as Pearl Morrisette cabernet franc and small-batch Beattie’s vodka, while the bathrooms feature handcrafted Pearl+ soaps. Perhaps the most distinctive features of most rooms are the deep-set window benches, many of which overlook the recently redesigned park across the street; they’re perfect for stretching out with a book or magazine after a day exploring the city.', 'Food and drink\n\xa0Most will agree that Alder, the hotel’s subterranean dining room, is a highlight of any visit to the Ace, both culinarily and in terms of ambiance. Bathed in a warm glow provided by custom-designed sconce and hanging lights, the restaurant is reached via a pair of copper-colored steel staircases, which, as they’re being descended, provide the first realization for many that the lobby bar above Alder is actually a platform suspended from the concrete ceiling high above by thin steel cables. Thoughts of architecture recede, however, once the mostly wood-fired food, overseen by star Toronto chef Patrick Kriss, is ordered and served (don’t even think of leaving the place without trying the grilled carpaccio, the tender grilled octopus and the gluten-free coconut cream pie). At roof level, the recently opened bar Evangeline offers small plates, DJs on some nights, a terrace during warm weather, and killer views of the city. It’s the perfect place to cap off an evening with a signature Ace Martini, composed of local gin, vermouth, mastiha, and a splash of tarragon brine.', 'The neighborhood/area\n\xa0Although it sits within easy access of three of Toronto’s most visited downtown enclaves, the Ace’s site at the juncture of two unassuming side streets wasn’t initially a lively one. That’s quickly changing. Directly across the street from the hotel, a former waterworks building capped with a new condo complex is about to re-open as a much-anticipated food hall. To the immediate south on King Street West, a massive residential complex by the starchitecture firm BIG will soon add new apartments and retail to the ’hood. It’s unclear which of these projects made it to the drawing board first, but Ace Hotels do often galvanize the areas in which they alight.', 'The service\n\xa0Service can be described as intermittently solicitous and casual. On one occasion a phone call to Room Service for ice (tiny cork-covered buckets are provided in each room) may result in rapid delivery to the room; on another it may require a trip to the basement-level ice machine. Attention is more consistent in the restaurant, where Alder’s Scottish-born general manager provides excellent recommendations (and repartee) and servers go as far as dictating the order in which dishes should be consumed. Service in the busy rooftop bar—especially once the DJs start spinning—can be hit or miss, although the drinks generally flow and the food is just as tasty as it is in the main restaurant.', 'For families\n\xa0Not too many kids were spotted at the hotel during a recent two-night stay, although that reimagined park across the street—actually dubbed St. Andrew’s Playground Park—offers plenty of amenities for small fry. Mostly, though, the hotel itself is a playpen for grownups.', 'Accessibility\n\xa0The hotel is fully accessible, with a prominent entrance ramp leading wheelchair users and others directly to the front desk. A small number of accessible rooms offer roll- or walk-in showers.', 'Anything left to mention?\n\xa0Like other Ace hotels, the Toronto property incorporates a wealth of art by local artists throughout its premises. Perhaps the most prominent here is\xa0\nHorizon Line\n by lead co-architect A. Howard Sutcliffe; a mural composed of weathered, stained, and untreated plywood pieces, it towers over the tables at Alder and is meant to suggest the twinkling waters of nearby Lake Ontario. Almost every floor of the hotel, however, is peppered with works by Canadian talents both emerging and well-known, including such names as Dennis Lin, Nadia Gohar, Guillermo Trejo, and Claudia Gutierrez. Be sure to seek out as many as possible over the course of a stay.']","51 Camden St, Toronto, ON M5V 1V2, Canada",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/toronto/ace-hotel-toronto,https://acehotel.com/toronto/

It remains the beating heart of the downtown, in a metropolis now known as Hollywood North for the number of films shot here. (Eighty-five were in progress during my visit.) On any given night, smartly dressed Vancouverites fill the award-winning Hawksworth Restaurant, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries beneath an enormous ceiling-length chandelier.

This was a careful, tasteful transformation; the grandeur and history of the hotel was clearly respected, allowing the Georgia to once again assume its place as one of the finest Vancouver hotels.

Oh, and Errol Flynn was booked into the Georgia for his final hotel stay on earth; he died in October 1959 while he was in town hoping to broker the sale of his yacht.', ""We're interested. If we're looking ahead at reservations, are there any rooms in particular we should try to book?\nThere are no bad rooms, and even the smallest, at 300-square-feet, feels spacious. You’ll want to spend time here or in your spa-like bathroom, with its heated marble floors. Try to get a room overlooking the Vancouver Art Gallery across the street. Or better yet, choose the Lord Stanley suite: with a private rooftop terrace, hot tub, and fireplace, it's a knockout."", ""Food and drink: Are there any good options on campus, or should we plan on going elsewhere?\nEven if you were marooned at your hotel for the whole trip, you could do a whole lot worse than being stuck at the Hotel Georgia. Hawksworth Restaurant is one of the most respected fine dining establishments in Vancouver; bars include the glitzy subterranean Prohibition, a speakeasy-style nightspot and the charming 1927 Lounge.

It’s only open from April to October, plus a brief stint around the winter holidays."", 'How do you find the service, start to finish?\nThe is a smooth, well-oiled machine.

But after the 2011 reboot, it has become even more indispensable to the area, and to the city itself. It was always a landmark, sure; today, however, it's a dynamic centerpiece of the downtown core."", ""Is there anything you'd change?\nWe wish Reflections were open year-round."", 'Any other little details that made your stay all the more comfortable?\nWe love the complimentary car service; you can cruise to points downtown in a Bentley or Mercedes.', 'Bottom line: Worth it?

Some 80 years later, an extensive five-year renovation to the tune of $75 million was completed on the downtown Vancouver property, and with it came Fairmont Gold, a hotel within a hotel. For guests who book a Gold room or suite, check-in takes place on your own floor (9 or 14), and a full breakfast is available just inside the private lounge, which in my case was roughly six steps away from my room. Ceramic pots of delicious fresh salmon were among the offerings I scooped up each morning before padding back to my room, coffee and meal in hand (I had to WFH—work from hotel; otherwise I’d have sat down in one of the lounge’s many banquettes or tables). While there is plenty of great food to be had around the city—and in the lobby at the always-bustling Notch8 Restaurant and Bar—there was a much-appreciated ease to having afternoon tea, evening hors d’oeuvres, or the aforementioned morning meal so accessible, and I imagine even more so for families traveling together. The grandiose hotel’s Art Deco–influenced aesthetic leans into deep blues and bronzes, with marble and velvet accents—a look that carries into the rooms too. Left in place after the renovation was much of the building’s original woodwork, crown moldings, and built-in decorative fireplaces that keep the hotel’s historic feel alive and well. More modern (and welcomed) touches I made use of during my restful stay: Le Labo bath products, an in-room Nespresso maker, the 24-hour gym and sauna, and an indoor pool open year-round.

NYC-based Parts and Labor Design did the interiors, which are streamlined and purposeful with knowing nods to the area’s maritime legacy. But its real power play is the restaurant and skyline bar, both partnerships with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, which could be stand-alone openings of the year in their own right. Maialino Mare, a seafood-focused sister spot to the beloved New York City trattoria, is already the hottest reservation in town (political bigwigs Nancy Pelosi and journalist Maureen Dowd were at its launch).

In addition to its premier location, the hotel is modern and clean, with high ceilings and tall glass windows everywhere that give it great light, no matter what area you're in.

It's too smart to be dismissed as hip or trendy—it's sophisticated, low-key, and likely will attract all walks of D.C.'s international crowd."", ""What's the backstory?\n D.C. is a natural fit for an outpost of the selective boutique line. Thompson Hotels became part of Hyatt in late 2018; but being part of a major hotel conglomerate doesn't seem to have affected the design-focused hotel brand. It's still a limited portfolio, hotels have a commonality that speaks to Thompson but they all are designed and executed individually. The layout makes great use of both the waterfront views and access; curved walls and porthole-style lights and mirrored accents, for example, link to the neighborhood's long history as a naval center."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n I had a standard king room and loved the space and layout. Mine had views of the Anacostia River, a smart and stylish small desk nook, great cabinetry for clothing and bar, and large bathroom. The bed was heavenly; pillows fluffy and sheets perfectly soft and light. The wooden accents and floors made the room feel warm; modern light fixtures and furniture gave it style. Tech was easy and seamless. It was the perfect spot to relax and to work—whatever I needed, the room could support it.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n No charge for Wi-Fi. A little slow at times, but otherwise helpful.', ""Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n The Thompson Washington, D.C. has partnered with Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group to power its dining program. Maialino Mare, a seafood-focused sister spot to New York City's Roman trattoria, quickly became the city's hottest reservation for its pasta with seafood, especially the bucatini all'Amatriciana—as well as Union Square's renowned service standards. The restaurant group also manages the hotel's in-room dining, which is a win (waking up to a pot of coffee, river views, and a Fontina cheese omelette with prosciutto and arugula is dreamy); it also runs the hotel's rooftop bar, Anchovy Social, which has a small but smart cocktail list, snack menu, and wraparound terrace. Note that Union Square Hospitality establishments fold service and gratuity into their pricing model, so no tipping is necessary."", ""How's the service at the hotel?\n It's amazing to me that a hotel this new has a staff so warm, friendly, and familial already. Whether it's the doorman filling you in on neighborhood trivia, the bartender at Anchovy Social chatting you away as he makes your drink, staffers just pausing to check on you as they pass you in the hallway, everyone here seemed happy and friendly, and attentive at all hours."", ""What type of travelers will you find here?\n While D.C. is known as a city that plays host to international visitors and residents all the time, it still can be hard to find a hotel or restaurant or bar that reflects its diversity. People really do seem to stick to their tribes in this town. But Thompson Washington D.C. is set up to draw in D.C.'s diversity—it reflects a sophistication and warmth that can cater to all walks and types. The steady stream of locals coming in just to grab a drink or a bite proved that out."", ""What about the neighborhood? What else is here?\n The city has developed The Yards over some 10 years very thoughtfully and carefully; the addition of Thompson Washington D.C. is no exception. The hotel has partnerships set up with local stores, eateries, fitness centers, and spas; its access to the neighborhood's highlights is immediate. The staff is happy to tell you their favorite spots nearby so that you have plenty to explore when you arrive."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n There is a great fitness center in the hotel, but the partnerships with nearby fitness centers and a local rooftop pool may better serve guests, getting them out into the neighborhood to experience it. The Yards has a great range of lauded restaurants and bars nearby—but having Maialino Mare and Anchovy Social on site may mean guests barely leave.', ""Bottom line: Worth it?\n Absolutely.

It's also a draw for hip travelers who are in D.C. for fun, rather than for business (or at least, not government-related business)."", ""How are the rooms?\nAll 220 guest rooms are located in a seamlessly annexed new build (the lobby and bar, as well as the restaurants, are in the old church part of the hotel). This was the Line's second property—the first is in \nLos Angeles\n, and the latest is in \nAustin\n—and while there isn’t really a shared aesthetic between the three, there’s definitely a philosophical through-line: each feels spot-on for its location. For the D.C. property, this means design details that wink at the building’s ecclesiastic history: Wood floors in guest rooms mimic the church’s herringbone oak floors, original mahogany pews are repurposed as lobby seating, salvaged pages from hymnals and yellowed collection envelopes are beautifully framed and hung in the rooms, and unlacquered brass hardware in the bathroom will eventually patina to the same green as the vestibule door that you walk through to enter the hotel. The individual rooms are bright and airy, with huge windows, white walls hung with original artwork, bright, graphic yellow and black bedspreads, and industrial-chic brass light fixtures. All the rooms are big (over 300 square feet), so if you don't need the extra bed, the entry-level king room is just great. The real splurge is the 1,200-square foot monumental master suite with a 1,300-square foot terrace that has panoramic views of the capital. If you need two beds, the double queen is the way to go, though some of the rooms and suites can also be adjoined for group or family travel."", ""How were the Wi-fi, the amenities, and the little things?\nThe Wi-fi was free and fast. The hotel has its own radio station (a first for me) called Full Service Radio, which is a community podcast network and internet radio station that broadcasts live from a studio in the lobby. If you tune in, you'll hear local hosts, plus programming that spotlights \nD.C.'s art and culture, food and beverage, and music scenes."", 'Did you order room service? How was it?\nYou can order food off of the \nBrothers And Sisters\n menu 24 hours a day, but it was the roaming cocktail cart that patrols the halls from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. that I was most excited about. Call the restaurant at least two hours in advance to arrange in-room cocktail service from a traveling bartender.', 'Quick: tell us something (or a few things) you really loved about the hotel.\nThe food and drink offerings are a real draw here, both for locals and visitors, and besides Brothers and Sisters (overseen by Erik Bruner-Yang of D.C.’s buzzy \nMaketto\n) includes \nA Rake’s Progress\n (headed by Spike Gjerde of Baltimore’s Woodberry Kitchen).', 'So, why are we staying here over another hotel?\nIn a city that\'s traditionally very industry and sort of ""meh"" when it comes to anything that\'s not a museum or a monument, it stands out for being a seriously cool hotel with excellent design and really great food and drink offerings.']","1770 Euclid Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20009, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/washington-dc/the-line-dc,http://thelinehoteldc.com/

"Conrad Washington, DC","Readers' Choice Awards, 2019. Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Opened in 2019, the hotel is the flagship property for the Conrad brand, and Hilton’s first luxury offering in the nation’s capital. The overall ethos of the collection tends towards the unfussy and uncluttered, and this flagship is definitely right in line with that vibe. Interiors firm Rottet Studio has created 360 bright, airy rooms with streamlined, contemporary décor. Suites have extras like low-slung couches and fireplaces, and all rooms have marble bathrooms with double vanities, walk-in showers, and ByRedo bath amenities. As one of the newer spots in town, the Conrad brings a modern sensibility to D.C's upscale hotel landscape, along with a convenient location, efficient service and destination dining from local favorite Ria Montes. Depending on the season, prices can be very reasonable, too.","[""Why did this hotel catch your attention?\n Just blocks from The White House, in the heart of downtown, the hotel anchors the recently-created CityCenterDC mixed-use development, a five-block complex that features residential and commercial spaces and dozens of shopping and dining options. Once up in the sleek hotel tower, though, you’ll feel far away from it all—though the 10-floor building, designed by Pritzker Prize Laureates Herzog & de Meuron (of London's \nThe Tate Modern\n and Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium fame), is flooded with natural light and downtown views at every turn, thanks to an all-glass exterior. The lobby, check-in and main dining and lounging spaces are located on the third floor, adding to the above-the-fray feel."", ""What's the backstory?\n Opened in 2019, the hotel is the flagship property for the Conrad brand, and Hilton’s first luxury offering in the nation’s capital. The hotel itself is owned by an array of real estate companies and investors, chief among them the Qatari royal family—which means if the owners are in town, expect to find plenty of men in black and strict security measures."", 'Tell us all about the accommodations. Any tips on what to book?\n While Conrad is one of Hilton’s luxury brands, the overall ethos of the collection tends towards the unfussy and uncluttered, and this flagship is definitely right in line with that vibe. Interiors firm Rottet Studio has created 360 bright, airy rooms with a streamlined contemporary décor of modular furnishings and a muted color palette of whites, grays, and light woods; in most, the unadorned, white linen-topped beds take center stages. Suites have extras like low-slung couches and fireplaces, and all rooms have marble bathrooms with double vanities, walk-in showers, and ByRedo bath amenities, but overall, the feel is pretty simple. (In what seems to be a Conrad standard, the hotel doesn’t do evening turn-down, so you won’t even find any extra touches to the bedside table come bedtime.) Rooms to get are the Premium Corner King, which have a wraparound wall of windows.', 'Is there a charge for Wi-Fi?\n Wi-fi is free in the rooms and public areas; faster Premium service comes with fee.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n Estuary, The Conrad’s signature restaurant, is led by DC-based Chef Ria Montes and brings an innovative and seasonal approach to the flavors of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (don’t miss the brunch.) Just off the lobby atrium, the circular Estuary Bar is an elegant spot drinks, though the real nighttime star is the \nSummit rooftop bar\n and lounge, serving libations and light bites with its 360-degree city views—a must come sunset. There are also a couple of furnished outdoor terraces and cozy nooks dotted around the main atrium to which you can order something from the lobby bar.', 'How was the service?\n Front desk service was efficient if a bit corporate, while the staff in the restaurant had more personality and a warmer touch.', ""What type of travelers will you find here?\n The extensive ballroom and meeting facilities make it popular with corporate, group, and event clients, while the location makes for a good hub for visiting officials and dignitaries, and locals looking for a discreet spot for meetings or power lunches. I didn't spy many families, though the room sizes can comfortably accommodate kids."", ""What about the neighborhood? What else is here?\n The location in CityCenterDC means there's a ton of shopping and dining within walking distance, along with each access to major monuments and Metro lines. The setting, service, and value on privacy make this a solid luxury option in town—particularly for guests whose tastes tend towards the more modern and unfussy, who might prefer this over the city's more traditionally old school five-star options."", ""Any other hotel features worth noting?\n Take note of the hotels contemporary art collection, which has been curated by consulting firm Tatar Art Projects and pays homage to the city’s Washington Color School and other historic art movements. A first for Conrad, the 10th-floor Sakura Lounge—which can be accessed by guests of certain room categories, or via an additional fee—serves as an all-day retreat offering dedicated butler and concierge service, perks like free pressing and priority reservations for the rooftop, meeting spaces, and three chef-created meal presentations a day, plus all-day drinks and snacks. Be sure to try some of the lounge’s private reserve Japanese whiskeys or—if you’re here on a weekend—the afternoon tea. There's a decent gym with walls of windows, but no spa or wellness facilities."", ""Bottom line: Why should we choose the Conrad?\n As one of the newer spots in town, the Conrad brings a modern sensibility to D.C's upscale hotel landscape, along with a convenient location, efficient service and \ndestination dining\n.

The Dupont Circle Hotel,"Readers' Choice Awards, 2021. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"Wedged into a crook just off its namesake park, The Dupont Circle gives off warmth from the moment a uniformed bellhop swings open a massive glass door, revealing a low-ceilinged lobby—a remnant of the building’s 1950s origins. It feels like a private members’ club, one that’s confident enough to do its own thing—and one the bold-face names will soon be angling to join. Dupont Circle is an upscale neighborhood with tree- and townhouse-lined streets and a buzzy after-work scene; if you’re into happy hours and oyster specials, you needn’t go far to find one. The hotel is within a nice walk of one end of the National Mall; meander straight past the White House and you’ll soon reach the Washington Monument on your right and the National Museum of African American History and Culture on your left. The space got a remodel from design firm Clodagh and architect Martin Brudnizki and is a real stunner.  ","['Why did this hotel catch your attention?\n Wedged into a crook just off its namesake park, The Dupont Circle may not have the street-level gravitas of some its kin, but one feels its warm personality the moment a uniformed bellhop swings open a massive glass door, revealing a low-ceilinged lobby—a remnant of the building’s 1950s origins. Much like a living room, the tidy space offers plenty of places to post up before a meeting, type away on a laptop, or wait for an Uber. Pops of brass glisten in the sunlight, which streams through the wall of floor-to-ceiling windows.', 'Give us the backstory on this place.\n A member of the UK-based Doyle Collection since 1997, The Dupont Circle got a multi-million-dollar renovation that includes a gleaming new lobby, rooms refreshed by the firm Clodagh and revamped food and drink outlets by Martin Brudnizki Design Studio (MBDS). When complete, a new 5,000-square-foot penthouse, also by Clodagh, will be among the largest hotel suites in D.C.', 'Tell us about your room. Is it cozy or swanky?\n The all-suites 9th floor feels like a luxury condo building, with plush hallway carpeting and heavy, extra-wide doors. Our 600-square-foot King Luxury Suite had a living room with a wet bar, a spacious bathroom, a doored bedroom, and a generous balcony spanning the entire length. A soft palette of creams, grays, and muted purples ran throughout. With upholstered walls, two armchairs, reading lights, and luxurious black-out drapes, the suite could have easily doubled as someone’s swanky D.C. pied-a-terre.', 'How about the bed, bath and all the rest of the decor?\n The king-size poster bed, dressed with crisp white linens, a nubby throw blanket, and purple-and-cream accent pillows, was ultra comfortable, and various surfaces—a console under the TV, a coffee table, a wet bar countertop, and a desk—provided ample room to unpack without resorting to the floor. The decadent marble bathroom had a glass-walled shower (with three individual shower heads), a separate soaking tub with a flat-screen TV, a heated towel rack, and a cornucopia of Malin + Goetz toiletries.', ""How about the food and drink?\n In 2019 the space that once housed Cafe Dupont reopened as The Pembroke, complete with a glamorous new look from the Swedish interior architect Martin Brudnizki. Almost since its reopening the restaurant became something of a local hangout. The menu, steered by chef Marlon Rambaran, formerly of the legendary (and now-shuttered) Le Bec Fin in Philadelphia, offers enough variety that hotel guests won't get bored even if they had multiple meals here over the course of a stay. Lunch and dinner pull diverse influences into perfectly dressed salads; mussels in coconut-curry broth; veal Milanese; a house burger; and tuna tartare (a stellar recent special). Half-portions of pasta and a kids’ menu of bento-box-like entrees and sides feel especially hospitable."", 'How did you find the service?\n It was outstanding from the moment we checked in (early, no sweat). The housekeeper learned our infant son’s sleep schedule after a single night and tweaked her turn-down service accordingly. Particularly notable was the front-of-house staff at The Pembroke—everyone was so warm and gracious that it wouldn’t be unreasonable to hire them as babysitters.', 'Who else are we going to see here?\n Rollaboards aside, it’s hard to believe this is a hotel. Everyone you see—from the women sipping after-work Vieux Carres at the bar Doyle to the dapper foursome by the window at the restaurant—looks like they live and work in D.C. Some do, of course, but even the farther-flung guests are a savvy, well-traveled bunch—the only fanny packs you’ll see here are the latest matelassé beauts by Gucci.', 'How does the hotel fit in with everything else in the neighborhood?\n Dupont Circle is an upscale neighborhood with tree- and townhouse-lined streets and a buzzy after-work scene; if you’re into happy hours and oyster specials, you needn’t go far to find one. The hotel sits a block from the Red Line for easy access to Union Station, and within a nice walk of one end of the \nNational Mall\n; meander straight past the White House and you’ll soon reach the \nWashington Monument\n on your right and the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture\n on your left.', ""Tell us what we missed.\n The generous cocktail spread atop our suite’s mirrored wet bar included a full stainless steel shaker set; 375 mL bottles of Tanqueray, Makers Mark, and other top-shelf booze; a bowl of fresh citrus; and even a little sealed jar of olives. We also appreciated the suite's ample, well-placed outlets and, in the bathroom, the dental kit and black makeup towel."", 'Bottom line: Why are we choosing the Dupont Circle?\n The newly renovated Dupont Circle is like that one friend who always looks glamorous and effortless, even though she eschews ostentatious designer merch for her own mix—likely from brands you’ve never even heard of. There are plenty of other big-name luxury hotels in the neighborhood, all of which attract heads of state, foreign dignitaries, and tourists loyal to certain logos. The Dupont Circle feels more like a private members’ club, one that’s confident enough to do its own thing—and one the bold-face names will soon be angling to join.']","1500 New Hampshire Ave. NW, Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C. 20036, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/washington-d-c/the-dupont-circle-hotel,http://www.jurysdoyle.com/usa/washington_hotel.htm
Riggs Washington D.C.,"Hot List, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2020. Readers' Choice Awards, 2022. Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",2,"In a capital scene abuzz with newcomers, Riggs easily grabs the attention. The first American property from Lore Group, the firm behind Sea Containers London and Pulitzer Amsterdam, is housed in a former bank dating from 1891. Nearly two dozen American presidents came here to do business, stepping into the very same sweeping lobby. The reception desk, a modern interpretation of a teller counter, furthers the theme. Yet there’s a fun-spiritedness not usually associated with personal finances, from the swirly wallpaper and headboard fabric by NYC-based design studio Voutsa to the clever spin on a bank safe that houses the mini-bar. Off the lobby, Café Riggs, steered by Momofuku alum Patrick Curran, works for quick coffees and power lunches alike, provided you can stop staring at the high ceilings and Corinthian columns. Downstairs in the former bank vault, Silver Lyan, from bartending superstar Ryan Chetiyawardana (Mr Lyan), slings high-concept house cocktails in an underground speakeasy. Everything from the Manhattan cherries to the art (a tongue-and-cheek optical illusion) chimes with the hotel’s sense of whimsy and fun. Here the dress code may be buttoned up, but make sure the top one is undone.  —Sarah Firshein","['Why did this hotel catch your attention?\n Occupying a grand, elegant building in the heart of Washington’s Penn Quarter, Riggs doesn’t need to do much to announce its presence. The architecture alone catches the eye—just as it should, as one of the last remaining Romanesque Revival buildings in the city. Hanging over the main entrance, a sign bearing the name “The Riggs National Bank” hints at the property’s fascinating backstory.', 'What is the backstory then?\n The first U.S. property from Lore Group, the hospitality firm behind \nSea Containers London\n and \nPulitzer Amsterdam\n, Riggs lives in an 1891 former bank that serves as both namesake and design inspiration. Twenty-three former U.S. presidents came here to wheel and deal, stepping into the very same sweeping, barrel-vaulted elevator bank that has now been gloriously restored. The personal-finance theme starts at the reception area—marked by a stately L-shaped desk reminiscent of a teller counter—and continues in various ways throughout the 181-room property. Before Lore Group gave the landmarked building a redo, it had been a Courtyard by Marriott.', 'Tell us all about the rooms. Any tips on what to book?\n Classic rooms are large and lovely, with swirly wallpaper and headboard fabric designed by the firm Voutsa. But we got even more room to spread out in the Louisa Adams Suite—one of four specialty suites inspired by four former First Ladies. Here, Lore Group creative director Jacu Strauss let loose with a yellow-and-black color scheme and elements that reference Adams’s love of concerts, including a baby grand piano. (Pro tip: Play it in your PJs.) The minibar was tucked into a large, rectangular steel “safe” with a brass plaque of Juno Moneta, the Roman goddess of money, emblazoned on the front. Bathrooms were awash in Carrara marble, sleek chrome hardware, and navy pinstripe wallpaper.', 'Drinking and dining—what are we looking at?\n With massive windows on two walls, 22-foot ceilings, original marble columns, and diverse seating areas, the all-day Cafe Riggs works just as well for a morning coffee as it does for a special-occasion dinner. At the helm is Patrick Curran, a Momofuku alum who elevates soft-scrambled eggs with quinoa and pepper relish and drenches seemingly humble broccoli in a sesame-garlic vinaigrette so good that it could convince a toddler to finally eat something green. The menu will likely delight locals (who can visit anytime) and guests who stay for a while; if you’re only in town for weekend, you might find yourself wondering how to try as many things as possible over the course of a short visit.', 'Downstairs, meanwhile, Silver Lyan is the first U.S. venture from the international bartending superstar Ryan Chetiyawardana (AKA Mr Lyan). Here, tucked into what used to be the vault, Maraschino cherries are spherified, and Guinness is served in Champagne flutes. But you can just as easily order anything else, be it a spritz or a glass of wine, and settle into the chic subterranean space. And be sure to take a good look at the physical menu itself—we won’t ruin the surprise, but the design is just as clever as the high-concept cocktails.', 'And the service?\n Service seemed overall solid: friendly, personal, and attentive. No single staff-member stood out, but no complaints, either.', 'What about the neighborhood? What else is here?\n Well-trafficked by tourists and locals alike, the Penn Quarter/Chinatown area is where several major Metro lines (including the Red line, which zooms over to Union Station in a matter of minutes) converge. The National Portrait Gallery is kitty-corner across the street; like all Smithsonian museums, it’s free, making it a clutch lunchtime excursion. Also within a stone’s throw: great shopping and dining that suits the everyday (Shake Shack, The Smith) as well as splurge meals (\nMiniBar\n by Jose Andres). Most of the other hotels in the neighborhood are larger chains.', ""Is there anything you'd change?\n Strange as it is to complain about a Barcelona Daybed—one of Mies Van Der Rohe’s seminal furniture designs—our suite could have benefitted from a more traditional (read: comfortable) sofa. And delightful as it was to have an uncomplicated in-room thermostat, ours was programmed not to dip below 68 degrees—that could be a real issue for cold sleepers, particularly in Washington’s notoriously hot and humid summers."", 'Any other hotel features worth noting?\n The most pilfer-worthy item in the room is the Riggs-branded umbrella, which pops open to reveal the same pattern as the headboard fabric. There’s an 1,800-square-foot gym with Peloton bikes and a 2,500-square-foot rooftop event space. There’s also a single neon-pink light illuminating one of the stalls in the women’s restrooms in Cafe Riggs—we’re not sure what it’s for or why it’s there, but it’s fabulous.', 'Bottom line: Why are we choosing Riggs?\n Washington’s hotel boom is approaching fever pitch—the city has recently welcomed locations of Thompson, \nConrad\n, and Generator. Even stalwarts like \nRosewood\n and \nDupont Circle\n are sporting brand-new looks. There are more options now than ever before, but Riggs’s exemplary design, destination dining, and whimsical details—all within the confines of landmarked architecture—makes it an instant standout.']","900 F St NW, Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C. 20004, United States",https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/washington-dc/riggs-washington-dc,https://www.riggsdc.com/

Readers' Choice Awards, 2023.",3,"Before Buenos Aires surrendered to the motor car—and every Argentine male modeled his ego on that of Formula One legend Juan Manuel Fangio—Avenida Alvear was one of the city’s main thoroughfares, with horse-drawn carriages and trams rolling by en route to Palermo’s gardens and shaded parks. Something of this Belle Epoque spirit still endures and nowhere more so than at the Palacio Duhau, completed in 1934 as the city mansion of a landed family. Its grand neoclassical façade is right on the avenue, and the lobby is a stately, serene space where light pours in from the terrace onto the fluted marble columns, intricately carved wooden doors and low-slung white leather sofas. The tiered gardens on the terrace are worthy of a scene in The Great Gatsby. Rooms range from spacious and functional to sumptuous and palatial; the boudoir suite has butler service, an enormous marble bathroom and, perhaps more impressive, two private terraces overlooking the avenue below. The Duhau restaurant and public spaces channel the property’s storied glamour, with local couples having lunch and out-of-towners sipping rum-laced Arnaud’s milk-punch cocktails. The surrounding barrio of Recoleta is known for its old-world architecture, and this hotel, modeled on the Château du Marais near Paris, is the maximum expression of Argentine Francophilia. Its only rival on this stately strip is the Alvear Palace—but where the latter flaunts its ostentation, the Hyatt’s grandest South American hotel rather keeps itself to itself.","[""Sell me on the place: What's it like, at its core?\nUnderstated, palatial elegance in downtown Buenos Aires, which dominates the city’s hotel scene—a reborn, impressively crafted hit of nostalgia."", ""How did it strike you on arrival?\nIn one of the poshest corners of Recoleta is this neoclassical mansion from the 1930s that has been impeccably restored.
